system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"<scroll id=1 class=android.widget.ScrollView >\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'Accounts' section is typically where user management options are found, and the presence of a scroll element suggests there may be more content to explore that could lead to task fulfillment.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it's clear that a previous attempt was made to access the 'Accounts' section, but it resulted in an error and necessitated a navigation back.

Step 2: Analyzing the "Successive Results," all clickable elements (id=3 to id=11) lead to the same 'Accounts' page, which suggests that clicking on any of these will not directly lead to the option to delete a guest user named Alice. The results for each of these IDs are identical and not specifically related to the task of deleting a guest user. However, the hint suggests that there may be more content to explore in the 'Accounts' section that could lead to task fulfillment.

Step 3: Given the hint and the fact that the error occurred when trying to access 'Accounts' previously, it seems likely that the correct path to deleting a guest user would be found by exploring further in the 'Accounts' section. Since all clickable elements lead to the same result, and we have a hint suggesting to continue exploring, the <scroll> element (id=1) is the most relevant UI element to interact with next.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above, I would provide the following ratings:

- The clickable divs (id=3 to id=11) all lead to the same 'Accounts' page, but since they don't directly relate to the task of deleting a guest user, they should be rated lower. However, they are not completely irrelevant, as they do relate to the 'Accounts' section where the task might be completed.
- The <scroll> element (id=1) is the most relevant since it allows us to explore more options that could potentially lead to the option to delete a guest user.

Given these considerations, here are the scores:

{
    "id_1": 8.00, 
    "id_2": 1.00, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 2.00, 
    "id_5": 2.00, 
    "id_6": 2.00, 
    "id_7": 2.00, 
    "id_8": 2.00, 
    "id_9": 2.00, 
    "id_10": 2.00, 
    "id_11": 2.00
