system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: The history indicates that the user has previously attempted to click on an element related to "Accounts" but navigated back due to an error. They have also scrolled forward on the android.widget.ScrollView.

Step 2: We need to find an element related to managing accounts, as the task is to delete a guest user named Alice. The hint suggests that the "Accounts" section is the correct place to manage user accounts, which aligns with the typical Android settings layout.

Step 3: Since the user has already encountered an error with the "Accounts" section before, we need to ensure that we are clicking the correct element this time. The "Accounts" section is usually where user management, including deletion, takes place. Based on the successive results, all div elements lead to a similar "Accounts" page, but we know from the hint and common UI patterns that the "Accounts" section (id_6) is likely where we need to go.

Step 4: Synthesizing the information, the clickable element with the 'android:id/title' Accounts (id_6) should be the next element to operate on because it directly relates to managing user accounts. Since the user has already made a mistake with this element, we should be cautious, but it's still the most likely candidate. The <scroll/> element (id_1) should also have a relatively high score because the user may need to scroll to find the specific account named "Alice" if it's not immediately visible. Other elements are not directly related to the task of deleting a guest user and should be rated lower.
