system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Review the "History operation sequence":
- The user initially clicked on "Network & internet" and then "Advanced" but navigated back due to an error, which indicates those options did not lead to the desired task of resetting network settings.
- The user scrolled forward twice and then clicked on "System" followed by "Advanced", which suggests that the user is in the correct submenu for system-related settings but hasn't yet found the reset option.

Step 2: Assess the "Current UI screen" for relevant options:
- The user is currently on a screen with various system settings, including "Languages & input," "Gestures," "Date & time," "Backup," "Reset options," "Multiple users," "Developer options," and "System update."
- Based on the task to "Reset all network settings on the phone," the "Reset options" element is the most relevant because it mentions that network settings can be reset.

Step 3: Decide the next step:
- Given the task and the hint provided, the "Reset options" element is the correct choice since it directly relates to resetting network settings.

Step 4: Synthesize the output with scores:
- "Languages & input," "Gestures," "Date & time," "Backup," "Multiple users," "Developer options," and "System update" are not directly related to resetting network settings, so they will receive lower scores.
- "Reset options" is the most relevant and will receive the highest score.
