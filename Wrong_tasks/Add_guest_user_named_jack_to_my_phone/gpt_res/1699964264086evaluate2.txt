system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

        "Click on clickable 'android:id/title' Network & internet 'android:id/summary' Wi\u2011Fi, mobile, data usage, and hotspot"
    ],
    "Current UI screen": "<p class=''  > Network & internet </p>\n<div id=1  description='Wi\u2011Fi' clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Wi\u2011Fi </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Not connected </p>\n\n    <switch id=2 class='com.android.settings:id/switchWidget' clickable > On </switch>\n </div>\n<div id=3   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Mobile network </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > T-Mobile </p>\n </div>\n<div id=4   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Airplane mode </p>\n\n    <switch id=5 class='android:id/switch_widget' clickable > Off </switch>\n </div>\n<div id=6   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Mobile plan </p>\n </div>\n<div id=7   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Hotspot & tethering </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Off </p>\n </div>\n<div id=8   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Advanced </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Data Saver, VPN, Private DNS </p>\n </div>\n",
    "Successive results": {},
    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"clickable 'android:id/title' Advanced 'android:id/summary' Data Saver, VPN, Private DNS\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'Advanced' section may contain further network settings, including the option to reset network settings, which is necessary to complete the user's task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The user has clicked on "Network & internet" which is the correct section for network-related settings but hasn't reached the reset network settings option yet.

Step 2: From the given UI elements, none of them directly suggest a reset of network settings. However, the "Advanced" section typically contains additional settings that are not immediately visible on the main page. Since the task is to reset all network settings, it is likely that such an option would be found under an "Advanced" subsection.

The hint provided also suggests that the "Advanced" section should be the next step, as it may contain the option to reset network settings.

Step 3: Based on the information provided, the next logical step is to click on the "Advanced" section to look for the reset network settings option.

Here are the confidence ratings for the UI elements:

- "Wi-Fi" (id_1) is not directly related to resetting network settings, but it is a network setting. It might be tempting to consider this, but it doesn't align with the task. (Rating: 2.00)
- The switch for Wi-Fi (id_2) is for turning Wi-Fi on or off, not for resetting network settings. (Rating: 1.00)
- "Mobile network" (id_3) is another setting related to network but does not imply a reset. (Rating: 2.00)
- "Airplane mode" and its switch (id_4 and id_5) are not related to resetting network settings. (Rating: 1.00)
- "Mobile plan" (id_6) is not related to the task of resetting network settings. (Rating: 1.00)
- "Hotspot & tethering" (id_7) is a feature within network settings but not related to resetting them. (Rating: 2.00)
- "Advanced" (id_8) is the most likely place to find the option to reset network settings, as per the hint and standard UI patterns. (Rating: 9.50)

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output, here is the JSON object with the scores:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 1.00, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 2.00, 
    "id_8": 9.50
