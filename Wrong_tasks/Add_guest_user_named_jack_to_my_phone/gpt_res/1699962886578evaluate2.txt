system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," the user initially attempted to access network settings via the "Network & internet" and "Advanced" options but had to navigate back due to errors. Subsequently, the user scrolled forward, suggesting that the correct path has not yet been found.

Step 2: The "Current UI screen" lists various settings such as Sound, Storage, Privacy, etc., but none of these are directly related to network settings. Therefore, none of the clickable div elements presented (id_2 to id_11) are relevant to the task of resetting network settings.

Step 3: Based on the hint provided and the absence of relevant options on the current screen, the most appropriate next action is to continue scrolling to reveal more options. It is likely that the option to reset network settings is further down in the list.

Step 4: Assigning scores based on relevance to the task:
- All clickable elements (id_2 to id_11) are unrelated to the task of resetting network settings, so they will receive a low score.
- The <scroll> element (id_1) is the most promising action to take next, as it may reveal the necessary option to reset network settings.

Here are the scores for the UI elements:

{
    "id_1": 8.00,  // Scrolling is the next logical step to find the network settings.
    "id_2": 1.00,  // Sound settings are unrelated to network settings.
    "id_3": 1.00,  // Storage settings are unrelated to network settings.
    "id_4": 1.00,  // Privacy settings are unrelated to network settings.
    "id_5": 1.00,  // Location settings are unrelated to network settings.
    "id_6": 1.00,  // Security settings are unrelated to network settings.
    "id_7": 1.00,  // Account settings are unrelated to network settings.
    "id_8": 1.00,  // Accessibility settings are unrelated to network settings.
    "id_9": 1.00,  // Digital Wellbeing & parental controls are unrelated to network settings.
    "id_10": 1.00, // Google services & preferences are unrelated to network settings.
    "id_11": 1.00  // System settings are unlikely to contain network reset but could be explored if network settings are not found after scrolling.
