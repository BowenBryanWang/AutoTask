system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.


user:
{
    "Task": "Remove the Google account kinnplh from the phone",
    "History operation sequence": [
        "Scroll forward on android.widget.ScrollView",
        "Click on clickable 'android:id/title' Accounts 'android:id/summary' Google"
    ],
    "Current UI screen": "<p class=''  > Accounts </p>\n<p class='android:id/title'  > ACCOUNTS FOR ADMIN </p>\n<div id=1   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > kinnplh@gmail.com </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Google </p>\n </div>\n<div id=2   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > laixiruyun@gmail.com </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Google </p>\n </div>\n<div id=3   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Add account </p>\n </div>\n<div id=4   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Automatically sync app data </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Let apps refresh data automatically </p>\n\n    <switch id=5 class='android:id/switch_widget' clickable > Off </switch>\n </div>\n",
    "Successive results": {},
    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"kinnplh@gmail.com\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'kinnplh@gmail.com' account is visible and clickable on the current UI page, which is the necessary next step for removing the account as per the user's task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The history shows that the user has scrolled through the settings and clicked on the "Accounts" section, specifically selecting "Google" accounts. There is no indication of a wrong step that led to a navigate back.

Step 2: The current UI screen displays multiple accounts under "ACCOUNTS FOR ADMIN" and options related to account management. Since the task is to remove the Google account "kinnplh@gmail.com", the clickable element with the email "kinnplh@gmail.com" is directly relevant to the task.

Step 3: The next step should be to click on the element associated with "kinnplh@gmail.com" to proceed with the account removal process. The hint provided confirms that selecting "kinnplh@gmail.com" is the correct next step.

Step 4: Scoring the elements on the screen based on their relevance to the task:

- id_1 corresponds to "kinnplh@gmail.com" and is the target account to be removed. This is the most relevant element to the task. Score: 10.00
- id_2 corresponds to "laixiruyun@gmail.com" and is not the target account. It is irrelevant to the task at hand. Score: 1.00
- id_3 is for adding a new account, which is the opposite of the task. Score: 1.00
- id_4 is an option for automatic sync settings, which is unrelated to account removal. Score: 1.00
- id_5 is a switch for the sync setting, also unrelated to the task. Score: 1.00

The JSON object with the scores is as follows:

{
    "id_1": 10.00,
    "id_2": 1.00,
    "id_3": 1.00,
    "id_4": 1.00,
    "id_5": 1.00
}
