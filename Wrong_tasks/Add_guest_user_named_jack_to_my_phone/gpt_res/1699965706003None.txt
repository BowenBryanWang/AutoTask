system:
the following string cannot be parsed to a dict (or list) by the built-in function eval (in Python) due to the error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 4).

{
    "id_1": 2.00,
    "id_2": 2.00,
    "id_3": 7.50, // 'Add account' is the most relevant option based on the hint and the task.
    "id_4": 1.00, // Sync settings are not relevant to adding a user.
    "id_5": 1.00  // The switch within id_4 is also not relevant.
}

Please correct its format error and output the correct string. Do not output anything else.
