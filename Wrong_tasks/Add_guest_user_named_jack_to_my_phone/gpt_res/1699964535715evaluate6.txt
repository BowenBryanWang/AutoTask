system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The current UI page contains the 'Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth' option which the user needs to select to reset all network settings, thus moving towards task fulfillment.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," the user initially navigated to "Network & internet" and then "Advanced," but had to navigate back twice, indicating those paths were incorrect. The correct path was found by scrolling and navigating to "System" > "Advanced" > "Reset options."

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen," there are three options related to resetting different aspects of the phone. There are no "Successive results" provided, but based on the given task and hint, the option to "Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth" is the most relevant to resetting all network settings on the phone.

Step 3: The next operation should be to click on the option that will reset the network settings. The hint provided by another model suggests selecting "Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth," which aligns with the task of resetting all network settings.

Step 4: Scoring the UI elements according to their relevance to the task:
- "Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth" is the direct action needed to reset network settings, so it gets the highest score.
- "Reset app preferences" is not directly related to network settings, so it gets a lower score.
- "Erase all data (factory reset)" is a much broader action and not specific to network settings, so it gets a lower score as well, but slightly higher than "Reset app preferences" because it would technically reset network settings as part of a complete device reset, although it's not the desired action for this task.

JSON object with scores:
{
    "id_1": 10.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 4.00
