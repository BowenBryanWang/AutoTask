system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", the user has scrolled through the settings and clicked on a Google account, which was not the correct action for adding a guest user. The task requires adding a new user account, not interacting with an existing Google account.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen", there are several elements:
- id_1: An existing Gmail account (kinnplh@gmail.com), which is not relevant to adding a new user.
- id_2: Another existing Gmail account (laixiruyun@gmail.com), which is also not relevant to adding a new user.
- id_3: The "Add account" option, which seems to be the correct path for adding a new user account.
- id_4: An option for automatically syncing app data, which is unrelated to the task at hand.
- id_5: A switch for toggling the automatic sync feature, which is also unrelated to the task.

Step 3: Based on the hint and the task, the next logical step is to interact with the "Add account" option, which likely leads to the process of adding a new user account to the phone.

Step 4: Scoring the UI elements based on their relevance to the task:

- id_1: This is an existing account and does not contribute to the task of adding a new user. Rating: 1.00
- id_2: Similar to id_1, this is another existing account and is not relevant to adding a new user. Rating: 1.00
- id_3: This is the correct option for adding a new account, which is the needed step to then add a guest user. Rating: 10.00
- id_4: Sync settings are not related to the task of adding a new user. Rating: 1.00
- id_5: A switch within the sync settings, also not related to adding a new user. Rating: 1.00

Outputting the final scores as a JSON object:

{
    "id_1": 1.00, "id_2": 1.00, "id_3": 10.00, "id_4": 1.00, "id_5": 1.00
}
