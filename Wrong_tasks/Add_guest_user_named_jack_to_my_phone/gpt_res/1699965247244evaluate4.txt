system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.


user:
{
    "Task": "Remove the Google account kinnplh from the phone",
    "History operation sequence": [
        "Scroll forward on android.widget.ScrollView",
        "Click on clickable 'android:id/title' Accounts 'android:id/summary' Google",
        "Click on clickable 'android:id/title' kinnplh@gmail.com 'android:id/summary' Google"
    ],
    "Current UI screen": "<p class=''  > Google </p>\n<p class='com.android.settings:id/entity_header_title'  > kinnplh@gmail.com </p>\n<div id=1   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Google Account </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Info, security & personalization </p>\n </div>\n<div id=2   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Account sync </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Sync on for all items </p>\n </div>\n<button id=3 class='com.android.settings:id/button'  > Remove account </button>\n",
    "Successive results": {},
    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"'com.android.settings:id/button' Remove account\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'Remove account' button on the current UI page is the appropriate element to operate next in order to complete the task of removing the Google account 'kinnplh'.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Review the "History operation sequence" to understand the actions that have been done so far. The user has scrolled through the settings, accessed the Accounts section, and selected the Google account with the email "kinnplh@gmail.com".

Step 2: Evaluate the "Current UI screen" elements and how they relate to the task of removing the Google account "kinnplh". The UI elements available are:
- A section with the title "Google Account" and a summary "Info, security & personalization" (id_1).
- A section with the title "Account sync" and a summary "Sync on for all items" (id_2).
- A button labeled "Remove account" (id_3).

Step 3: Decide the next step based on relevance to the task. 
- The "Google Account" section (id_1) provides information about the account but is not an actionable item for removal; it has minor relevance.
- The "Account sync" section (id_2) is related to synchronization settings and not to the removal of the account; it also has minor relevance.
- The "Remove account" button (id_3) is directly related to the task at hand and is the actionable item that the user needs to interact with to remove the account.

Based on the provided hint and the assessment of the UI elements, the "Remove account" button (id_3) is the most appropriate element to operate next.

Step 4: Synthesize the ratings based on relevance to the task:
- id_1: Minor relevance, as it is informational rather than actionable.
- id_2: Minor relevance, as it deals with sync settings rather than account removal.
- id_3: Highest relevance, as it is the direct action required to complete the task.

Given these considerations, the JSON object with scores is as follows:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 10.00
}
