system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", it seems that the user has navigated through the settings to reach the reset options, specifically targeting network settings. There were multiple attempts to reset the network settings which did not respond, leading to repeated clicks on the 'Reset settings' button. This indicates that the user is in the correct area for resetting network settings but may have encountered an issue with the button not responding.

Step 2: The "Successive results" for "id=1" shows that clicking on the 'Reset settings' button will lead to the confirmation message and the action to reset network settings, which is the intended task.

Step 3: Based on the "Current UI screen", the user is presented with a confirmation message and a 'Reset settings' button that needs to be operated to complete the task of resetting all network settings. There are no other UI elements available for interaction, and the "Hint" from another model also suggests that the 'Reset settings' button is the correct element to proceed with.

Given the information and the goal to reset all network settings, the 'Reset settings' button (id=1) is the only relevant and actionable element on the current screen that will lead to the completion of the task.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output, the JSON object with scores would be:

{
    "id_1": 10.00
}

The 'Reset settings' button is the most likely to be chosen and executed, hence it receives the highest possible score.
