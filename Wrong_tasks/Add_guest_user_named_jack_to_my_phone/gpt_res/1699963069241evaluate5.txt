system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," the user previously navigated to "Network & internet" and "Advanced" settings but had to navigate back due to errors. The user has also attempted scrolling multiple times without success, indicating they may have been looking for the reset option in the wrong section. The last successful step was clicking on "Advanced" under the "System" category, which is likely the correct path to resetting network settings.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen," there are several options, but based on the task to reset all network settings, the "Reset options" element stands out as it mentions "Network, apps, or device can be reset." None of the other elements on the current screen seem directly related to resetting network settings.

Step 3: Considering the user's task and the hint provided, the next logical step is to click on the "Reset options" element. This is because it explicitly mentions the ability to reset network settings, which is the user's goal.

Based on the evaluation, here are the scores for the UI elements:

- "Languages & input" (id_1) is not related to resetting network settings.
- "Gestures" (id_2) is not related to resetting network settings.
- "Date & time" (id_3) is not related to resetting network settings.
- "Backup" (id_4) is not related to resetting network settings.
- "Reset options" (id_5) is directly related to the task.
- "Multiple users" (id_6) is not related to resetting network settings.
- "Developer options" (id_7) is not related to resetting network settings.
- "System update" (id_8) is not related to resetting network settings.

Based on this analysis, the JSON object with the scores for the UI elements is as follows:

{
    "id_1": 1.00,
    "id_2": 1.00,
    "id_3": 1.00,
    "id_4": 1.00,
    "id_5": 10.00,
    "id_6": 1.00,
    "id_7": 1.00,
    "id_8": 1.00
}
