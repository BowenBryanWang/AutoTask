system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: The history shows that the user has navigated back due to errors multiple times and has scrolled through the settings without finding the right option. The last valid action taken was clicking on 'System' which is where they are currently.

Step 2: The current screen lists several options under 'System': Languages & input, Gestures, Date & time, Backup, and Advanced. None of the first four options are related to network settings. However, 'Advanced' mentions 'Reset options', which is likely to contain the network reset setting.

Step 3: According to the hint provided by another model, the 'Advanced' option should be selected next as it contains 'Reset options'. This aligns with the logical path to find the network reset setting.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above, the JSON object with scores for the UI elements on the current page would be:

{
    "id_1": 1.00,  // Languages & input is not related to network settings
    "id_2": 1.00,  // Gestures is not related to network settings
    "id_3": 1.00,  // Date & time is not related to network settings
    "id_4": 1.00,  // Backup is not related to network settings
    "id_5": 10.00  // Advanced contains 'Reset options' which is likely to lead to network reset
}
