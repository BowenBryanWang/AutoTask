system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no history of operations, so this is the starting point for the task of removing a Google account from the phone.

Step 2: Considering the task at hand, none of the currently visible UI elements directly relate to removing a Google account. However, such an option is likely to be found within the settings related to accounts or users. The "Privacy" option (id_9) might seem relevant due to its mention of "account activity," but it typically relates to permissions and data privacy rather than account management.

Step 3: Since none of the visible elements are directly related to account management, the next step should be to scroll to explore more options that might lead to account settings. The "Accounts" or similar option is what we're looking for, but it's not visible on the current screen.

Step 4: I will assign a score that reflects the need to scroll to find the correct option for account management.

Here is the synthesized output:

{
    "id_1": 7.50, "id_2": 1.00, "id_3": 1.00, "id_4": 1.00, "id_5": 1.00, "id_6": 1.00, "id_7": 1.00, "id_8": 1.00, "id_9": 2.50, "id_10": 1.00
}

I have given the highest score to the scroll action (id_1) as it is the most likely to lead to the account management option. The "Privacy" option (id_9) has been given a slightly higher score than the other unrelated options because of its tangential relevance to accounts, but it is still not the primary target for this task. All other options are given the lowest score because they do not relate to the task of removing a Google account.
