system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

Step 1: The history operation sequence indicates that the user has navigated through various settings menus, initially going into "Network & internet" and "Advanced," then backtracking due to errors. The user scrolled through a ScrollView multiple times and encountered an unresponsive action, which was also an error. Eventually, the user navigated to "System," then "Advanced," and successfully reached "Reset options" and selected "Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth."

Step 2: The current UI screen shows a page titled "Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth" and provides information about what this action will reset. There is a button with the ID 'id_1' labeled "Reset settings." According to the given hint, this button is the correct UI element to complete the task of resetting all network settings on the phone.

Step 3: The next step is straightforward. Since the user's task is to reset all network settings and they are currently on the correct page with a button that initiates this reset, the user should click the "Reset settings" button.

Step 4: Synthesizing the information from the previous steps, the "Reset settings" button is the most relevant UI element to the task at hand. Therefore, it should receive the highest score.

Given that the "Reset settings" button is the only interactive element on the current UI screen and it is the direct way to accomplish the task, it will be rated as follows:

{
    "id_1": 10.00
}
