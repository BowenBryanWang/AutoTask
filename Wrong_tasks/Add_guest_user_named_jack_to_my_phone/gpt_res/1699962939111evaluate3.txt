system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: The user is trying to reset all network settings on the phone. Previous steps involved navigating to "Network & internet" and then to "Advanced", but these actions were followed by errors and navigations back, indicating those paths were incorrect. The user has scrolled forward twice on the settings page.

Step 2: The current UI elements visible on the screen include various settings like Storage, Privacy, Location, Security, Accounts, Accessibility, Digital Wellbeing & parental controls, Google, System, and About emulated device. None of these options directly relate to resetting network settings.

Step 3: Following the hint provided by another model and considering that the "Reset network settings" option is typically found in the System or General Management section of the settings, and it has not appeared yet on the screen, the next logical step would be to continue scrolling to reveal more options.

Step 4: Assigning scores to each UI element based on their relevance to the task:

- The scrollable view (id=1) is the most relevant as it is the only element that allows the user to navigate further in the settings to potentially find the "Reset network settings" option.
- All other clickable items (id=2 to id=11) are related to different settings and do not directly relate to the task of resetting network settings. However, without further information, we cannot completely rule them out as they might lead to sub-menus where the option could be located. Still, their relevance is significantly lower than the scroll action.

Based on the above reasoning, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:

{
    "id_1": 8.00,  // Scrolling is the most relevant action to find the reset network settings.
    "id_2": 2.00,  // Storage settings are not relevant to network settings.
    "id_3": 2.00,  // Privacy settings are not relevant to network settings.
    "id_4": 2.00,  // Location settings are not relevant to network settings.
    "id_5": 2.00,  // Security settings are not relevant to network settings.
    "id_6": 2.00,  // Accounts settings are not relevant to network settings.
    "id_7": 2.00,  // Accessibility settings are not relevant to network settings.
    "id_8": 2.00,  // Digital Wellbeing & parental controls are not relevant to network settings.
    "id_9": 2.00,  // Google services & preferences are not directly relevant to network settings.
    "id_10": 4.00, // System settings could potentially contain the network reset option.
    "id_11": 2.00  // About device is not relevant to resetting network settings.
