system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no "History operation sequence" provided, indicating this is the first interaction with the UI in this task.

Step 2: We have to look through the options provided on the current UI screen to find the one most relevant to the task of resetting network settings. The task explicitly states "network settings," so we should look for an option related to network, Wi-Fi, mobile data, etc.

- "Network & internet" (id_2) is highly relevant because it includes settings for Wi-Fi, mobile data, and other network-related settings.
- "Connected devices" (id_3) is less relevant because it deals with peripherals and not the core network settings.
- "Apps & notifications" (id_4), "Battery" (id_5), "Display" (id_6), "Sound" (id_7), "Storage" (id_8), "Privacy" (id_9), and "Location" (id_10) are not directly related to resetting network settings.

Step 3: The next step should be to navigate to the "Network & internet" settings where we can expect to find an option to reset network settings.

Step 4: Based on the analysis, here are the scores for the UI elements:

- "Network & internet" is the most relevant option for the task at hand.
- "Connected devices" has some relevance to network settings but not for resetting them.
- All other options are not relevant to the task of resetting network settings.
- The <scroll /> element might reveal more options, but since "Network & internet" is already visible and highly relevant, it's less likely we need to scroll to find the reset option.

Here are the scored ratings:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 9.50, 
    "id_3": 1.50, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00, 
    "id_8": 1.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00, 
    "id_10": 1.00
