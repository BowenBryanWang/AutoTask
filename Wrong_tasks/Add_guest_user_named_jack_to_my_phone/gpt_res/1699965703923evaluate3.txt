system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: Review the "History operation sequence" to understand the actions taken so far. The user attempted to add an account by clicking on 'Add account' but had to navigate back due to an error. This indicates that the previous attempt may have been on the wrong path or there was a mistake in the process.

Step 2: Analyze the "Successive results" for each UI option. All options (id=1, id=2, id=3, id=4) lead to a similar result, which is the ability to add different types of accounts (Exchange, Google, Personal IMAP/POP3). Since the task is to add a guest user, the typical approach would be to add a new user or profile rather than an email or service account, but the current UI does not provide a direct option for this.

The hint suggests that the 'Add account' option is still relevant, but from the previous history, we know that it led to an error. This could mean that the correct path wasn't followed after clicking 'Add account', or it could also mean that 'Add account' is not the correct option for adding a guest user.

Step 3: Decide on the next action. Since the previous attempt at using 'Add account' resulted in an error and the task is to add a guest user (which usually isn't the same as adding an email/service account), the current UI elements seem not to directly satisfy the task. However, without further UI options or a "Users & accounts" setting visible, the best course of action is to re-evaluate the 'Add account' option to see if there are any missed steps or alternative paths within that flow that could lead to adding a guest user.

Step 4: Synthesize the above output into a JSON object with scores. Since 'Add account' is the most relevant option given the current UI and the hint, but has previously led to an error, it will be rated the highest but with caution. The other accounts are irrelevant to the task of adding a guest user, so they will be rated lower. The switch for automatically syncing app data is also irrelevant to the task.

{
    "id_1": 2.00,
    "id_2": 2.00,
    "id_3": 7.50, // 'Add account' is the most relevant option based on the hint and the task.
    "id_4": 1.00, // Sync settings are not relevant to adding a user.
    "id_5": 1.00  // The switch within id_4 is also not relevant.
