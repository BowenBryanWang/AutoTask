system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

NOTE in this History Pages and Action Dict format:
1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

===response===
Step 1:
The user's task is to reset all network settings on the phone. The history of actions shows that the user has clicked on "Network & internet" from the main settings page, which is the correct section for network-related settings. This action is on the right track for the task at hand because resetting network settings would typically be found under the "Network & internet" settings.

Step 2:
The latest UI page lists several network-related options such as "Wi-Fi," "Mobile network," "Airplane mode," "Mobile plan," "Hotspot & tethering," and "Advanced." However, none of these options directly indicates a reset of the network settings. To fulfill the task of resetting all network settings, there should be an option such as "Reset network settings" or similar. Since this option is not visible on the current UI page, it suggests that either the option is located under one of the clickable items, possibly under "Advanced," or it is not present on this page at all.

Step 3:
The "Advanced" section is typically where additional network settings would be found, including potentially the reset option. Since this is a general purpose area for more detailed settings, it is worth exploring. No other elements with general purposes, such as a "<scroll />" element, are mentioned, so exploration is limited to the clickable elements on the current screen.

Step 4:
Synthesizing the information from the previous steps, the user is on the correct path by being in the "Network & internet" settings, but the current UI screen does not present a direct option to reset network settings. The "Advanced" section is a likely candidate for where this option could be found. Therefore, the status is "go on" with the next UI element to be operated being the "Advanced" section.

The resulting JSON object would be:

```json
{
    "next ui element": "clickable 'android:id/title' Advanced 'android:id/summary' Data Saver, VPN, Private DNS",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The user is in the correct section for network settings, but the reset option is not visible on the current screen. The 'Advanced' section is a logical place to look for more options, including potentially the reset network settings option."
}
```
