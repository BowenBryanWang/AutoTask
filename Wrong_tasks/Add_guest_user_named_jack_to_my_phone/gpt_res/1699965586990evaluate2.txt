system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

The presence of this category on the current UI page suggests that the user can continue with the task by selecting this option.

}

===response===
Step 1: The user has scrolled through the settings menu, likely looking for the correct option to add a guest user to the phone.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows various settings including Sound, Storage, Privacy, Location, Security, Accounts, Accessibility, Digital Wellbeing & parental controls, Google, and System. None of the successive results of these options have been provided, so we must rely on the names and summaries of these settings to determine their relevance to the task.

Step 3: To add a guest user to the phone, the user would typically need to navigate to the 'Users' or 'Accounts' section of the settings. In this case, the option for 'Accounts' seems the most relevant as it is generally where user account management is located. The other settings (Sound, Storage, Privacy, etc.) are not directly related to managing users on the device. Since we do not see an explicit 'Users' option, 'Accounts' is the most likely place to find the necessary settings to add a guest user. The hint provided also suggests that 'Accounts' is the correct path to proceed with the task.

Step 4: Based on the relevance to the task, here are the ratings for each UI element:

{
    "id_1": 8.00, // Scroll, in case more options are needed.
    "id_2": 1.00, // Sound, not related to adding users.
    "id_3": 1.00, // Storage, not related to adding users.
    "id_4": 1.00, // Privacy, not related to adding users.
    "id_5": 1.00, // Location, not related to adding users.
    "id_6": 1.00, // Security, not directly related to adding users.
    "id_7": 9.50, // Accounts, highly likely to contain user management settings.
    "id_8": 1.00, // Accessibility, not related to adding users.
    "id_9": 1.00, // Digital Wellbeing & parental controls, not directly related to adding users.
    "id_10": 1.00, // Google, not directly related to adding users.
    "id_11": 1.00, // System, not directly related to adding users.
    "id_12": 1.00  // An empty clickable element, likely not relevant.
}

The 'Accounts' option (id_7) has the highest score as it is the most relevant to the task of adding a new user account. The scroll option (id_1) has the next highest score in case there are more options below that are not currently visible on the screen. All other options have a low score as they are not relevant to the task at hand.
