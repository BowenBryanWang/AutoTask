system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it appears that the user has navigated through the "Network & internet" settings and "System" settings, with some errors and back navigations. The user has now reached the "Reset options" which is the correct path towards resetting network settings.

Step 2: The "Current UI screen" shows three options:
- Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth
- Reset app preferences
- Erase all data (factory reset)

The user's task is to "Reset all network settings on the phone." Among the given options, "Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth" is the most relevant to the task, as it directly pertains to resetting network settings. The other two options, "Reset app preferences" and "Erase all data (factory reset)," do not specifically address network settings and are therefore less relevant to the current task.

Step 3: Based on the task and the hint provided, the next step should be to click on the option that resets network settings. The hint confirms that "Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth" is the correct next step to complete the task.

The confidence ratings for the UI elements on the current screen would be:
- "Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth": This is the direct action needed to reset network settings, hence the highest score.
- "Reset app preferences": This option is not directly related to network settings, but it might affect network-related app preferences, so it gets a lower score.
- "Erase all data (factory reset)": This would reset the entire phone, which is beyond the scope of the task, thus it receives the lowest score relevant to the task.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output, the JSON object with scores is as follows:

{
    "id_1": 10.00,
    "id_2": 2.00,
    "id_3": 1.00
}
