system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"Add account\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'Add account' option is available and relevant to the task of adding a guest user, suggesting that the user can proceed with this option to attempt to fulfill the task without needing to navigate back further.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it's clear that the user has previously attempted to add an account by clicking on "Add account" but navigated back due to an error. The user also clicked on individual Google accounts and navigated back due to an error. These attempts were not successful in adding a guest user.

Step 2: Considering the "Successive Results" of each UI option:
- Clicking on "id=1" or "id=2" leads to account details for specific Google accounts, which is not relevant to adding a new guest user.
- Clicking on "id=3" leads to a list of account types that can be added, which is relevant to the task.
- Clicking on "id=4" leads to sync settings for an existing account, which is not relevant to adding a new guest user.

Step 3: Deciding what should be done next:
- "id=1" and "id=2" are not relevant as they pertain to existing accounts.
- "id=3" is the Add account option, which is the most relevant to the task of adding a new guest user. Despite a previous error, the hint suggests that this option should be revisited as it is directly related to the task.
- "id=4" is not relevant as it pertains to sync settings.

Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores:
- "id=1" and "id=2" are related to existing accounts and not to adding a new user, so they receive a low score.
- "id=3" is the direct action to add a new account, which aligns with the task, so it receives the highest score.
- "id=4" is related to sync settings and not to adding a new user, so it receives a low score.

Based on the analysis, the scores are as follows:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 10.00, 
    "id_4": 2.00
