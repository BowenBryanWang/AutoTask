system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: Since the "History operation sequence" is empty, no previous steps have been taken, and there are no wrong steps to consider.

Step 2: We are looking for a UI element related to wireless emergency alerts, which would typically be found under settings related to sound, notifications, or security. Among the given options, none of the titles directly indicate a section for emergency alerts. However, "Apps & notifications" could potentially contain settings for emergency alerts, as these alerts are often managed in the notification settings of a phone.

Step 3: The best course of action is to look for a more relevant section that specifically deals with emergency alerts or notifications. Since it is not immediately visible, scrolling might reveal additional options that are more pertinent to the task. Therefore, the <scroll/> element should be given the highest score to explore further options in the UI.

Here are the ratings based on the relevance of each UI element to the task at hand:

- "Network & internet": This is unlikely to contain settings for emergency alerts. Rating: 2.00
- "Connected devices": This section is typically for Bluetooth and other device connections, not emergency alerts. Rating: 1.00
- "Apps & notifications": This could contain notification settings, which might include emergency alerts. Rating: 7.00
- "Battery": Unrelated to emergency alerts. Rating: 1.00
- "Display": Unrelated to emergency alerts. Rating: 1.00
- "Sound": May contain settings for alerts, but not specifically for emergency alerts. Rating: 5.00
- "Storage": Unrelated to emergency alerts. Rating: 1.00
- "Privacy": This section is usually for permissions and data management, not emergency alerts. Rating: 2.00
- <scroll/>: To explore more options that could be related to emergency alerts. Rating: 8.00

Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

{
    "id_1": 8.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 7.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 5.00, 
    "id_8": 1.00, 
    "id_9": 2.00
