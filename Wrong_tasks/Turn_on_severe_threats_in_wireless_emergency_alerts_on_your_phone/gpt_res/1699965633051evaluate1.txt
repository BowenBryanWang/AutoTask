system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no history of operation sequence provided, so there is no need to consider past mistakes or corrections at this point.

Step 2: Considering the task of enabling location permission for Google Play services on an Android device, we need to find the settings related to permissions, particularly those for apps, because location permissions are typically managed on an app-by-app basis.

- "Network & internet" (id_2): This category is not directly related to app permissions, so it scores lower.
- "Connected devices" (id_3): This is related to device connections like Bluetooth and does not pertain to app permissions.
- "Apps & notifications" (id_4): This could potentially lead to app-specific settings where permissions can be managed, so it scores higher.
- "Battery" (id_5): Battery settings are not related to permissions.
- "Display" (id_6): Display settings are not related to permissions.
- "Sound" (id_7): Sound settings are not related to permissions.
- "Storage" (id_8): Storage settings are not related to permissions.
- "Privacy" (id_9): This category is likely to contain permission settings as it mentions "Permissions" in the summary, so it scores the highest.

Step 3: The next step should be to navigate to the "Privacy" settings where we can find permission settings.

Based on the relevance to the task, here are the scores:

- "Network & internet" (id_2): Unrelated to the task at hand. Score: 2.00
- "Connected devices" (id_3): Unrelated to the task at hand. Score: 2.00
- "Apps & notifications" (id_4): Somewhat related, might contain app-specific settings. Score: 6.50
- "Battery" (id_5): Unrelated to the task at hand. Score: 2.00
- "Display" (id_6): Unrelated to the task at hand. Score: 2.00
- "Sound" (id_7): Unrelated to the task at hand. Score: 2.00
- "Storage" (id_8): Unrelated to the task at hand. Score: 2.00
- "Privacy" (id_9): Directly related to permission settings. Score: 9.50
- "<scroll />" (id_1): Since we identified a likely candidate, scrolling is less relevant. Score: 2.50

Step 4: Output the JSON object with scores:

{
    "id_1": 2.50, "id_2": 2.00, "id_3": 2.00, "id_4": 6.50, "id_5": 2.00, "id_6": 2.00, "id_7": 2.00, "id_8": 2.00, "id_9": 9.50
