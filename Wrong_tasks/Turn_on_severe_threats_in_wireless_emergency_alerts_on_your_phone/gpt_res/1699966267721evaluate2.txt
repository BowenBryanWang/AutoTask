system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "History operation sequence": [

    "Successive results": {},
    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"SEE ALL 18 APPS button\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The user has navigated to the 'Apps & notifications' section, and the 'SEE ALL 18 APPS' button on the current UI page is likely to lead to a list of all apps, where the Google app can be found and its cache and data cleared.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The user has navigated to the "Apps & notifications" section of the settings. No errors or wrong steps have been indicated in the history operation sequence.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows recently opened apps and other settings like Conversations, Notifications, Default apps, and Advanced. Since the task is to clear the cache and data in Google, the user needs to navigate to where the Google app can be found. The "SEE ALL 18 APPS" button suggests that it will lead to a list of all apps installed on the device.

Step 3: Based on the hint and the understanding of the task, the user should click the "SEE ALL 18 APPS" button to proceed to the list of all apps, where they can then find and select Google to clear its cache and data.

Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

- The "SEE ALL 18 APPS" button (id_3) is the most relevant element as it likely leads to the list of all apps, including Google.
- The recently opened apps (id_1 and id_2) are less relevant as they do not directly lead to the Google app.
- The Conversations, Notifications, Default apps, and Advanced sections (id_4, id_5, id_6, and id_7) are not relevant to the task at hand.

Therefore, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 10.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00
}
