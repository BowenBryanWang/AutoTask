system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no history of operations provided, so we start with a clean slate and no past errors to consider.

Step 2: The current UI screen provides several options, none of which directly indicate settings related to emergency broadcasts. However, emergency broadcast settings are typically found in the settings related to notifications or sound. The option "Apps & notifications" may contain notification settings where such an option could be found. Additionally, emergency broadcasts are a feature of the network services, so "Network & internet" might also be a relevant path to explore.

Step 3: Since "Apps & notifications" is a common place to find notification settings, and emergency broadcasts are a type of notification, this seems like a good place to start. "Network & internet" could also be relevant, but it is typically more associated with connectivity settings rather than notification settings. As there are no other options that are more relevant, we need to choose between these two. Given that emergency broadcasts are indeed notifications, I would give a higher score to "Apps & notifications".

Step 4: Since we are unsure and there is no clear indication of where emergency broadcast settings are located, we should also consider the possibility of scrolling to find more options. Therefore, the <scroll /> element should receive a higher score than unrelated options but a lower score than our primary candidates.

Here is the confidence rating for each UI element:

- "Network & internet" (id_2) might contain relevant settings for emergency broadcasts as they are tied to network services, but it's less likely than notification settings: 6.50.
- "Connected devices" (id_3) is unrelated to emergency broadcasts: 1.00.
- "Apps & notifications" (id_4) is the most likely place to find emergency broadcast settings as they are part of the notification system: 8.00.
- "Battery", "Display", "Sound", "Storage", and "Privacy" (ids 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are all unrelated to emergency broadcasts: 1.00.
- The <scroll /> element (id_1) should be given a moderate score as there may be more options below: 7.00.

Outputting the JSON object with scores:

{
    "id_1": 7.00,
    "id_2": 6.50,
    "id_3": 1.00,
    "id_4": 8.00,
    "id_5": 1.00,
    "id_6": 1.00,
    "id_7": 1.00,
    "id_8": 1.00,
    "id_9": 1.00
