system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"<scroll id=1 class=android.widget.ScrollView >\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The current UI does not show the wireless emergency alerts setting, but the presence of a ScrollView suggests that there may be more options below. Scrolling further could reveal the setting needed to complete the user's task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The history indicates that the user has already scrolled forward on the ScrollView, but the task has not yet been completed. There have been no incorrect steps that required navigating back.

Step 2: Based on the current UI screen, none of the visible options directly relate to "severe threats" or "wireless emergency alerts." The available options pertain to sound, storage, privacy, location, security, accounts, accessibility, Google services, and system settings. None of these options seem to be directly related to emergency alerts.

Step 3: Considering the hint provided by another model, which suggests that the user should continue scrolling to find the wireless emergency alerts setting, the next logical step would be to operate the ScrollView again by scrolling forward to reveal more options that are not currently visible on the screen.

Step 4: Synthesizing the information, the score for the ScrollView (id_1) should be the highest since it is the most likely candidate to reveal the setting we're looking for. All other visible options are not directly related to the user's task and thus should have a lower score. However, since the user is looking for a specific setting, the other options are not entirely irrelevant; they are just not the correct ones for this task.

Given the task at hand and the current UI options:

{
    "id_1": 9.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 2.00, 
    "id_5": 2.00, 
    "id_6": 2.00, 
    "id_7": 2.00, 
    "id_8": 2.00, 
    "id_9": 2.00, 
    "id_10": 2.00, 
    "id_11": 2.00
}

The ScrollView (id_1) has the highest score as it is the most likely element to help the user progress towards completing the task. The other elements are given a low score because they do not appear to be related to the task of finding and turning on severe threats in wireless emergency alerts.
