system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: The history operation sequence is empty, indicating that this is the initial step in the task of sharing Wi-Fi information via a QR code.

Step 2: In the current UI screen, we need to look for an entry point that would logically lead to Wi-Fi settings where we can access the QR code sharing feature. The option with the title "Network & internet" is the most relevant because it mentions Wi-Fi, which is directly related to the task.

Step 3: To proceed, we should select the "Network & internet" option to navigate to the Wi-Fi settings. None of the other options on the screen seem to be directly related to Wi-Fi settings or sharing Wi-Fi information.

Here are the ratings based on the relevance to the task:

- "Network & internet" directly mentions Wi-Fi and is therefore the most likely path to sharing Wi-Fi information via a QR code.
- The other options (Connected devices, Apps & notifications, Battery, Display, Sound, Storage, Privacy) do not mention Wi-Fi and are not directly related to the task.
- The <scroll> element has a potential to reveal more options that might be relevant, but since we already have a strong candidate, its score will be lower than the "Network & internet" option.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output, the JSON object with scores would be:

{
    "id_1": 7.00, "id_2": 9.50, "id_3": 1.00, "id_4": 1.00, "id_5": 1.00, "id_6": 1.00, "id_7": 1.00, "id_8": 1.00, "id_9": 1.00, "id_10": 1.00
}

The "id_2" has the highest score because it is the most relevant to the task.
