system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it appears that the user has correctly navigated to the "Permission manager" after accessing the "Privacy" settings. There are no indications of incorrect steps that have led to a navigate back action.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen," there are several permissions categories listed. Since the task is to enable location permission for the Google Map service, the relevant UI element is the one corresponding to "Location" permissions. No "Successive results" are provided, but based on the "Hint" and expert knowledge, the next step should be to interact with the Location permissions category.

Step 3: The correct action is to click on the clickable element that corresponds to "Location" permissions to manage which apps have access to the device's location services. This will allow the user to find and enable location permission for the Google Maps service.

Based on the provided information, here are the scores for the UI elements:

- "id_2" to "id_7" and "id_9" to "id_10" represent other permissions and are not directly related to the task at hand. They should receive lower scores.
- "id_1" is a <scroll /> element, which indicates there might be more permissions not currently visible on the screen. However, since the "Location" permission is already visible, the scroll action is not necessary at this moment. It should receive a lower score than the "Location" permission but higher than the unrelated permissions.
- "id_8" represents the "Location" permission, which is the target element for the current task. It should receive the highest score as it is the most relevant to the task.

Here are the ratings:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 1.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00, 
    "id_8": 10.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00, 
    "id_10": 1.00
