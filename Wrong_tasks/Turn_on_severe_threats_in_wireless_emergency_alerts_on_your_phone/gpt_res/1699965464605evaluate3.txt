system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: The user has accessed the "Network & internet" settings and then clicked on "Wi-Fi" to view Wi-Fi networks. There have been no wrong steps reported in the history.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows several elements related to Wi-Fi settings. Since the task is to share Wi-Fi information using a QR code, and the current screen does not explicitly show an option for sharing via QR code, the most likely path is to click on the settings for the connected Wi-Fi network (AndroidWifi). This could lead to additional settings where the option to share via a QR code might be found. The hint provided by another model also suggests clicking on the "AndroidWifi" connected network for further options.

Step 3: The next operation should be to click on the connected Wi-Fi network "AndroidWifi" to explore its settings, where the option to share the Wi-Fi information via a QR code might be available.

Here are the ratings based on relevance to the task:

- id_1 (switch bar to toggle Wi-Fi on/off): This is not directly related to the task of sharing Wi-Fi information via QR code. Rating: 2.00
- id_2 (switch to toggle Wi-Fi on/off): Same as id_1, not directly related to the task at hand. Rating: 2.00
- id_3 (scroll): The scroll element allows us to view more options, but the relevant option (AndroidWifi) is already visible. Rating: 3.00
- id_4 (AndroidWifi network settings): This is the most likely place where the option to share Wi-Fi information via QR code might be found. Rating: 9.50
- id_5 (Add network): This is for adding a new network, not for sharing existing Wi-Fi information. Rating: 2.00
- id_6 (Scan QR code for adding network): This is for scanning a QR code to add a new network, not for sharing. Rating: 2.00
- id_7 (Wi-Fi preferences): This may contain relevant settings but is less likely than the direct network settings. Rating: 4.00
- id_8 (Saved networks): This is for viewing saved networks, unlikely to provide sharing options directly. Rating: 3.00
- id_9 (Wi-Fi data usage): This is for viewing data usage and is not related to sharing Wi-Fi information. Rating: 1.00

Step 4: Output the ratings as a JSON object:

{
    "id_1": 2.00,
    "id_2": 2.00,
    "id_3": 3.00,
    "id_4": 9.50,
    "id_5": 2.00,
    "id_6": 2.00,
    "id_7": 4.00,
    "id_8": 3.00,
    "id_9": 1.00
