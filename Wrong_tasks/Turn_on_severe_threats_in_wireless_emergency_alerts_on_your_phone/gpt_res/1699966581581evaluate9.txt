system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," the user has navigated through the settings to the Google Play services storage management screen, cleared the cache, and attempted to clear storage. However, the task specifies clearing cache and data for "Google," which may refer to the Google app itself rather than the Google Play services. The user has not yet navigated back, suggesting that they have not made a wrong step in relation to their intended actions.

Step 2: On the current UI screen, the user is presented with options to manage search data, manage wearable storage, and clear all data for Google Play services. Since the task is to clear the cache and data in Google, the button to clear all data may be the relevant option, as suggested by the hint provided by another model. The hint indicates that the "CLEAR ALL DATA" button should be the next UI element to operate on to complete the task.

Step 3: Deciding what should be done next, the "CLEAR ALL DATA" button seems to be the correct option to complete the task of clearing cache and data for Google Play services. However, if the task specifically refers to the Google app and not Google Play services, the user would need to navigate back and select the Google app instead. Since the hint does not indicate a need to navigate back, and the history does not show an incorrect step, we will assume the task at hand is indeed related to Google Play services.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:

- The "MANAGE SEARCH DATA" button (id_1) is less relevant since it only manages search data, which is a subset of all data: 3.00.
- The "MANAGE WEARABLE STORAGE" button (id_2) is not relevant to the task of clearing cache and data for Google Play services: 2.00.
- The "CLEAR ALL DATA" button (id_3) is the most relevant and aligns with the hint provided, indicating it should be the next step to complete the task: 10.00.

Outputting the scores in the required format:

{
    "id_1": 3.00,
    "id_2": 2.00,
    "id_3": 10.00
}
