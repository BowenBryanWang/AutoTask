system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Scrolling is required to view more options and potentially complete the task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The history of operations indicates that the user has navigated to the correct section for managing location permissions for apps on an Android device. They have accessed the Permission Manager and selected Location to see which apps have permission to use the device's location. No steps indicate a wrong operation that caused a navigate back.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows a list of apps with their location permission status categorized under "ALLOWED" and "DENIED." Since the task is to enable location permission for Google Play services, we are looking for an option related to Google Play services in the list. However, it is not immediately visible on the current screen.

The hint suggests that the user should continue to interact with the scrollable list to find more apps whose permissions can be managed, which could include Google Play services.

Step 3: The next logical step is to interact with the scrollable list to look for Google Play services. Since the scrollable list (<scroll id=2>) is the only way to view additional apps that are not immediately visible, we should give it the highest score.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above steps, we arrive at the following JSON object with scores:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 9.50, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 2.00, 
    "id_5": 2.00, 
    "id_6": 2.00, 
    "id_7": 2.00, 
    "id_8": 2.00
}

Explanation of scores:
- "id_1": More options button, unlikely to be needed immediately, so it gets a lower score.
- "id_2": The scrollable list which is the most likely candidate for the next action, as it may reveal the Google Play services option.
- "id_3" to "id_8": These are specific apps that currently have their permissions set to allowed or denied. Since none of these are Google Play services, they are not immediately relevant to the task at hand and thus receive lower scores.
