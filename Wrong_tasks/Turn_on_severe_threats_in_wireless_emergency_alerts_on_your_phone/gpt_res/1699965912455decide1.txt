system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

===response===
Step 1:
The user's task is to enable location permission for the Google Map service on an Android device. The history of actions shows that the user has navigated to the "Privacy" section of the settings by clicking on the 'Privacy' option which is correct as permissions are managed within this section. The last action was navigating to a page that includes "Permission manager" which suggests the user is on the right path to finding the location permissions.

Step 2:
The latest UI page includes an option for "Permission manager" which is clickable. Since the task is to enable location permission, the "Permission manager" is likely where the user can control app-specific permissions, including location permissions. Therefore, the latest UI page does indeed provide a path that can lead to the fulfillment of the UI task.

Step 3:
There are no elements with GENERAL purposes that are worthy of being explored for the task at hand, other than the "Permission manager". Elements like "Show passwords" and "Notifications on lock screen" are not relevant to enabling location permissions. There are no <scroll /> elements indicating that there are more elements to explore on this page.

Step 4:
Synthesizing the above thoughts, the conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

{
    "next ui element": "Permission manager",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The 'Permission manager' element on the current UI page is the correct next step to manage app-specific permissions, including enabling location permissions for Google Map service."
