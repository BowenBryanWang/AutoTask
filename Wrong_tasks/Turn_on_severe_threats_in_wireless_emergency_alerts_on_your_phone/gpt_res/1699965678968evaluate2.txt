system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"Permission manager\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'Permission manager' option within the Privacy settings is the correct next step to manage and enable location permissions for the Google Play service.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The user has previously clicked on "Privacy" which is correct, as permissions are typically managed within the privacy settings of a device. There are no indications of a wrong step that caused a navigate back.

Step 2: The current UI screen presents several options related to privacy settings. To enable location permission for Google Play services, the user should look for settings related to app permissions. The option "Permission manager" seems to be the most relevant as it is described to "Control app access to your data," which would include location permissions.

The "Accessibility usage" is less relevant as it deals with apps that have full access to the device for accessibility reasons, not specifically location permissions. "Show passwords" and "Notifications on lock screen" are unrelated to permission management. The "Advanced" option may contain additional settings but is less direct than the "Permission manager" for this task.

Step 3: Based on the hint provided and the analysis of the options, the user should click on the "Permission manager" to proceed with enabling location permissions for Google Play services.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output, the scores for the UI elements would be:

- "id_1": 2.00 (Accessibility usage - minor relevance)
- "id_2": 9.71 (Permission manager - highest relevance)
- "id_3": 1.00 (Show passwords - irrelevant)
- "id_4": 1.00 (Switch for 'Show passwords' - irrelevant)
- "id_5": 1.00 (Notifications on lock screen - irrelevant)
- "id_6": 3.00 (Advanced - minor relevance, might contain related settings but not direct)

The resulting JSON object with the scores is:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 1.00, "id_4": 1.00, "id_5": 1.00, "id_6": 3.00
