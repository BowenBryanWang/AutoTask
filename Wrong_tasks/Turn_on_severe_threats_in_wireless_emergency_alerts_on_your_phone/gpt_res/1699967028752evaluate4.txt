system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it appears that multiple scrolls were performed, but one of the operations did not yield a response, indicating a possible error or a dead-end. The user then clicked on an element related to accessibility settings.

Step 2: The "Current UI screen" shows various accessibility options such as "Font size," "Display size," "Dark theme," "Magnification," "Large mouse pointer," and "Remove animations." None of these elements are directly related to wireless emergency alerts.

Step 3: Given the task is to turn on severe threats in wireless emergency alerts, and the current screen elements do not pertain to this task, the next logical step is to continue exploring the UI. The hint suggests scrolling to find more elements that might be related to the task.

Step 4: Scoring should reflect the next action based on the current context. Since none of the clickable elements on the current screen are relevant to the task, the scroll function has the highest relevance.

{
    "id_1": 8.50, // Scroll is the next best action to explore more options.
    "id_2": 1.00, // "ActionRecord" is not relevant to the task.
    "id_3": 1.00, // "Font size" is not relevant to the task.
    "id_4": 1.00, // "Display size" is not relevant to the task.
    "id_5": 1.00, // "Dark theme" is not relevant to the task.
    "id_6": 1.00, // The switch for "Dark theme" is not relevant to the task.
    "id_7": 1.00, // "Magnification" is not relevant to the task.
