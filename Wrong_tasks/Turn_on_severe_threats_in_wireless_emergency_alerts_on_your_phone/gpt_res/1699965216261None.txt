    "id_2": 1.00, // Recently opened apps - WebView Shell, not relevant
    "id_3": 1.00, // Recently opened apps - ActionRecord, not relevant
    "id_4": 1.00, // SEE ALL 18 APPS, not relevant
    "id_5": 1.00, // Conversations, not relevant
    "id_6": 1.00, // Notifications, not relevant
    "id_7": 1.00, // Default apps, not relevant
    "id_8": 1.00, // Permission manager, not relevant
    "id_9": 10.00, // Wireless emergency alerts, directly related to the task
    "id_10": 2.00 // Special app access, might be somewhat relevant but not the direct target
}
