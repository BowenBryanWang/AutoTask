system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no history of operations, so we don't have any previous steps to consider or any mistakes that have been made.

Step 2: The task is to check data usage on the device. Looking at the current UI screen, we have several options that could potentially lead to information about data usage:
- Network & internet: This is typically where you would find settings related to data usage.
- Connected devices: This is related to devices connected to the phone, such as Bluetooth, and is not relevant to data usage.
- Apps & notifications: This would be more about managing apps and notifications, not data usage.
- Battery: This shows battery-related information, not data usage.
- Display: This is for display settings and is also not relevant to data usage.
- Sound: This is for sound settings, unrelated to data usage.
- Storage: This shows information about storage space, not data usage.
- Privacy: This is more about permissions and personal data management, not data usage.

Step 3: Since the task is to check data usage, the "Network & internet" option is the most likely place to find this information. Therefore, this is the element we should operate on next.

Step 4: Based on the analysis above, I will assign the highest score to the "Network & internet" option because it is the most likely to lead to data usage information. All other options are not directly related to the task and will receive lower scores. The <scroll> element will receive a score higher than the unrelated options but lower than the "Network & internet" option as it is the container for all options.

Here is the JSON object with the scores:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 9.50, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00, 
    "id_8": 1.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00
}
