system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

NOTE in this History Pages and Action Dict format:
1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

===response===
Step 1: The last action taken by the user was to click on the "Apps & notifications" option in the settings menu. This action is on the right track for enabling emergency broadcast alerts because such settings are often found within the apps or notification settings of a phone. However, it is not guaranteed that this action alone will complete the task without further steps.

Step 2: The latest UI page shows various options related to apps and notifications, including "Recently opened apps," "Conversations," "Notifications," "Default apps," and an "Advanced" section that mentions "Wireless emergency alerts" among other things. The presence of the "Wireless emergency alerts" text suggests that this area could lead to the settings for emergency broadcast alerts. Therefore, the current UI can potentially lead to the task fulfillment.

Step 3: The "Advanced" section on the current UI page is of particular interest because it specifically mentions "Wireless emergency alerts." This implies that there could be settings within this section that allow the user to enable emergency broadcast alerts. Therefore, this element is worth exploring. Since there is a clickable element associated with "Wireless emergency alerts," the user can proceed by clicking on this option to potentially fulfill the task.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above thoughts, the conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

```json
{
    "next ui element": "Advanced 'android:id/title' Wireless emergency alerts",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The 'Advanced' section on the current UI page mentions 'Wireless emergency alerts,' indicating that the user can proceed by clicking this option to potentially enable emergency broadcast alerts."
}
```
