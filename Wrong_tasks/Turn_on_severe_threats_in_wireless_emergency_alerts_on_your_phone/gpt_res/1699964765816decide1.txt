system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

NOTE in this History Pages and Action Dict format:
1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

===response===
Step 1:
The user's task is to delete a user named Alice from the device. The history of actions shows that the user has navigated to the Accounts section of the settings by clicking on "Accounts" with the summary "No accounts added". This action seems to be on the correct track as the Accounts section is typically where user accounts can be managed, including adding and removing accounts.

Step 2:
The latest UI page shows elements related to account management, including an option to "Add account" and a toggle for "Automatically sync app data". However, there is no mention of any existing accounts or options to manage or delete them. To fulfill the task of deleting a user named Alice, there should be a list of accounts from which the user can select Alice's account and proceed to delete it. Since the summary previously mentioned "No accounts added", and no accounts are listed on the current page, it seems that there are no user accounts to delete on this device.

Step 3:
There are general-purpose elements on the screen, such as "Add account" and "Automatically sync app data", but none of these elements are relevant to the task of deleting an account. Since there is no indication of a scrollable area or any additional elements that might be related to account deletion, there are no further actions that can be taken on this page to complete the user's task of deleting a user named Alice.

Based on the above steps, the conclusion is as follows:

{
    "next ui element": null,
    "status": "wrong",
    "reason": "The current UI page does not show any accounts to manage or delete, and the task is to delete a user named Alice. Since there are no accounts listed, it is not possible to complete the task on this screen. It appears that either there are no accounts on the device, or the UI has not provided the necessary options to manage existing accounts."
