system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.


user:
{
    "Task": "Delete a user named Alice from the device.",
    "History operation sequence": [],
    "Current UI screen": "<scroll id=1 class=android.widget.ScrollView >\n    <div id=2   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Volume, vibration, Do Not Disturb </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=3   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Storage </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > 26% used - 5.89 GB free </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=4   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Privacy </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Permissions, account activity, personal data </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=5   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Location </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > On - 0 apps have access to location </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=6   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Security </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Screen lock, fingerprint </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=7   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Accounts </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > No accounts added </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=8   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Accessibility </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Screen readers, display, interaction controls </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=9   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Google </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Services & preferences </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=10   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > System </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Languages, gestures, time, backup </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=11   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > About emulated device </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Android SDK built for x86 </p>\n </div>\n </scroll>\n",

Step 1: There is no history of operations yet, so we are starting fresh.

Step 2: To delete a user named Alice from the device, we need to find the settings related to user accounts or user management. The "Accounts" section is typically where user accounts are managed on a device.

Step 3: From the current UI elements, we can see that there is a section with the title "Accounts" which is clickable and has a summary indicating "No accounts added". This could either mean that there are no accounts on the device (which would be inconsistent with the task, as we are supposed to delete a user named Alice), or it could mean that no additional accounts have been added beyond the primary one. Since the task is to delete a user, it's logical to explore the "Accounts" section further.

Step 4: Scoring the UI elements based on their relevance to the task:

- "Volume, vibration, Do Not Disturb" is unrelated to managing user accounts.
- "Storage" is also unrelated to user management.
- "Privacy" does not directly relate to user accounts, more to permissions and data.
- "Location" is not related to user management.
- "Security" is more about device security rather than user accounts.
- "Accounts" is highly relevant as this is where user management is typically done.
- "Accessibility" is unrelated to user management.
- "Google" is related to Google services and preferences, not user account management on the device.
- "System" is generally about device settings and not specifically about user accounts.
- "About emulated device" is information about the device and not related to user management.

Step 5: Assigning scores based on the analysis above:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 1.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 9.00, 
    "id_8": 1.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00, 
    "id_10": 1.00, 
    "id_11": 1.00
}

The "Accounts" section (id_7) is the most likely place where we could manage users, so it receives the highest score. The scroll (id_1) receives a lower score, as it's less likely that user management would be hidden further down in the scrollable list, but it still has a possibility if "Accounts" turns out to be incorrect, so it's rated higher than the other unrelated items.
