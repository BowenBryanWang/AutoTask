system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"Maps\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The user is on the correct screen to manage location permissions for individual apps, and the Google Maps app is present and clickable, which is necessary to complete the task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," the user has navigated through the settings to the "Permission manager" and selected "Location" to manage location permissions for apps. There are no indications of incorrect steps.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen," we have several elements:
- "More options" which is likely a settings or additional options menu.
- A scrollable list containing apps with their respective location permission status (ALLOWED/DENIED).
- Individual apps listed with clickable elements, including "Maps," which is relevant to the task.

Step 3: To enable location permission for Google Maps, the next logical step is to interact with the "Maps" element, as it directly relates to the task at hand.

Based on the provided hint and the task's goal, the "Maps" element is the correct choice as it is necessary to complete the task of enabling location permission for Google Maps.

Step 4: Scoring the UI elements:
- "More options" is less relevant at this point because we need to interact with the "Maps" app directly. Therefore, it gets a lower score.
- The scrollable list is important as it contains the apps, but since we can already see the "Maps" element, it's not necessary to scroll right now.
- The individual apps other than "Maps" are not relevant to the current task.

Here are the scores based on the reasoning above:

- "More options" (id_1): 2.00 (minor relevance, as it could potentially lead to settings but is not the direct action needed)
- Scroll (id_2): 3.00 (slightly more relevant than "More options" as it pertains to navigating the list of apps, but not immediately necessary)
- "ActionRecord" (id_3): 1.00 (irrelevant to the task)
- "Camera" (id_4): 1.00 (irrelevant to the task)
- "Gallery" (id_5): 1.00 (irrelevant to the task)
- "Maps" (id_6): 10.00 (directly relevant and the correct element to interact with)
- "Phone" (id_7): 1.00 (irrelevant to the task)
- "WebView Shell" (id_8): 1.00 (irrelevant to the task)

The JSON object with the scores is as follows:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 3.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 10.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00, 
    "id_8": 1.00
