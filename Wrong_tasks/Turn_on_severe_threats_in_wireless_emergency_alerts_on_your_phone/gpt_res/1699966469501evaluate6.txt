system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Successive results": {},
    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"Storage & cache\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'Storage & cache' element is present on the current UI page, which is where the user can clear the cache and data for 'Google Play services' to fulfill the task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the history operation sequence, the user has navigated through the settings to find Google Play services. There are no indications of incorrect steps that have led to a navigation back.

Step 2: The user's task is to clear the cache and data in Google. The current UI screen shows various options related to the Google Play services app, including "DISABLE", "FORCE STOP", and different settings like "Notifications", "Permissions", "Storage & cache", "Mobile data & Wi-Fi", and "Advanced".

Based on the given hint and expert knowledge, the "Storage & cache" option would be where the user can manage storage options and clear cache and data.

Step 3: The next step should be to navigate to the "Storage & cache" section to proceed with clearing the cache and data.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above information, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:

- "DISABLE" and "FORCE STOP" are not directly related to clearing cache and data. However, they are operational buttons in the app settings, so they have minor relevance.
- The "Notifications", "Permissions", "Mobile data & Wi-Fi", and "Advanced" options are not relevant to the task of clearing cache and data.
- The "Storage & cache" option is highly relevant as it directly relates to the user's task.

Therefore, the JSON object with scores is:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 10.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00
}
