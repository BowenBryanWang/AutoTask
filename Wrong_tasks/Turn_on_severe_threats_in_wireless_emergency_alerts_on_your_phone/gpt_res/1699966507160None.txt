system:
the following string cannot be parsed to a dict (or list) by the built-in function eval (in Python) due to the error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 2).

{
    "id_2": 9.50, // CLEAR STORAGE is highly relevant but should be the second step.
    "id_3": 10.00 // CLEAR CACHE is the most relevant and should be the first step.
}

Please correct its format error and output the correct string. Do not output anything else.
