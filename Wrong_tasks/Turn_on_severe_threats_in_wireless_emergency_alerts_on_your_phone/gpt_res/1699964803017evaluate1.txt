system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: Reviewing the history of operations, it's clear that a previous attempt was made to access the "Accounts" section but resulted in an error, leading to a navigation back.

Step 2: Analyzing the current UI screen, I see multiple clickable elements that lead to different settings. The task is to delete a user named Alice from the device, which would likely be done through the "Accounts" settings. The "Successive results" for each clickable element seem to be identical and are not directly related to the task at hand, as they mention "Add account" and "Automatically sync app data", which are not relevant to deleting an account.

Step 3: Since the goal is to delete an account and the "Accounts" section has been previously attempted without success, it's possible that the correct path was not taken or that the account named Alice was not visible on the first attempt. The element with id=7 explicitly mentions "Accounts" and "No accounts added", which seems to be the most relevant to the task, even though the summary suggests no accounts are present. However, it might be necessary to access this section to refresh or update the information or to find hidden options for managing accounts.

Considering the above points and the fact that all other elements lead to unrelated settings, I will give the highest score to the "Accounts" section (id=7), followed by a lower score to the scroll element (id=1) to suggest that more options could be explored if necessary.

Step 4: Synthesizing the output to provide scores for the UI elements:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 1.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 9.00, 
    "id_8": 1.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00, 
    "id_10": 1.00, 
    "id_11": 1.00
