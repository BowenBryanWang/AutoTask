system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: The history of operations indicates that there have been attempts to click on an element related to "Accounts" with a summary of "No accounts added." However, these attempts resulted in errors, leading to navigation back. It is important to note that the task is to delete a user named Alice from the device, not to add an account.

Step 2: The successive results indicate that clicking on any of the div elements (id=2 to id=11) leads to a screen related to "Accounts" with options to add an account and sync app data. However, none of these options directly indicate the ability to delete an account or a user named Alice.

Step 3: Given the task is to delete a user named Alice, and considering that the "Accounts" section is typically where user accounts can be managed on a device, the div with id=7, which is explicitly labeled "Accounts," should be the next element to interact with. It is likely that within the "Accounts" section, there may be a list of accounts where one can select and delete a specific user. The fact that the summary states "No accounts added" could be misleading or incorrect, possibly due to a synchronization issue or a UI glitch.

Step 4: Based on the relevance to the task of deleting a user, the clickable div with id=7 related to "Accounts" should have the highest score. The <scroll/> element should also have a relatively high score as there might be more elements related to user management off-screen. The other elements are less relevant to the task at hand and should be scored lower.

Outputting the scores in the required format:

{
    "id_1": 7.50, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 2.00, 
    "id_5": 2.00, 
    "id_6": 2.00, 
    "id_7": 9.00, 
    "id_8": 2.00, 
    "id_9": 2.00, 
    "id_10": 2.00, 
    "id_11": 2.00
