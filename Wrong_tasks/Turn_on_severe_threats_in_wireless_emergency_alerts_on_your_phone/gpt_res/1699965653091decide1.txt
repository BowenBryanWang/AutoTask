system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

===response===
Step 1: The history of actions indicates that the user has navigated from the main settings page to the "Privacy" section. The last action taken was clicking on the "Privacy" option, which is related to permissions and personal data. This action is on the correct track towards enabling location permissions for the Google Play service, as permissions are managed within the privacy settings on an Android device.

Step 2: The latest UI page includes several options within the Privacy settings, including "Accessibility usage," "Permission manager," "Show passwords," "Notifications on lock screen," and "Advanced." The "Permission manager" option stands out as the most relevant to the user's task of enabling location permission for the Google Play service. By clicking on the "Permission manager," the user can potentially access and control app permissions, including location services.

Step 3: Among the general-purpose elements on the screen, the "Permission manager" is the one that is most likely to lead to the fulfillment of the task. It is explicitly mentioned to "Control app access to your data," which would include location data. Therefore, the next logical step would be to explore the "Permission manager" by clicking on it. There are no <scroll /> elements indicating that there is more content to view on this screen, so the other elements listed may not directly contribute to the task at hand.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above thoughts, the conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

```json
{
    "next ui element": "Permission manager",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The 'Permission manager' option within the Privacy settings is the correct next step to manage and enable location permissions for the Google Play service."
}
```
