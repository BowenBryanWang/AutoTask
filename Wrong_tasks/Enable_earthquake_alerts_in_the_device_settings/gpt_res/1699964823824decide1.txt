system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

NOTE in this History Pages and Action Dict format:
1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

===response===
Step 1:
The history of actions shows that the user started by clicking on the "Accounts" option where it was indicated that no accounts were added. An error occurred that prompted a navigation back to the previous screen. The user then retried and clicked on the "Accounts" option again, leading to the current UI. The last action, which was to click on the "Accounts" option, is on the correct track for the task of deleting a user named Alice from the device, as managing users typically involves navigating to the accounts section. However, since the history indicates "No accounts added," it seems that the user Alice does not exist or is not listed, which means the task cannot be completed as there is no user to delete.

Step 2:
The latest UI page shows elements related to account management, including an option to "Add account" and settings for "Automatically sync app data." Since the task is to delete an account and the UI does not show any existing accounts (specifically not showing Alice's account), there is no direct way to complete the task from this UI. There is no element on the screen that allows for the deletion of an account.

Step 3:
There are no general-purpose elements that could lead to the completion of the task. The available elements are for adding an account and toggling data synchronization. There is no indication of a scrollable element or any other control that would suggest more options or accounts are available off-screen.

Step 4:
Based on the above steps, the task cannot be completed because there are no accounts to delete, and the current UI does not provide a way to delete an account. The status is "wrong" because the user needs to navigate back or to a different section where user accounts are listed and can be managed. Here is the conclusion in the requested JSON format:

```
{
    "next ui element": [],
    "status": "wrong",
    "reason": "The task is to delete a user named Alice, but the current UI indicates that no accounts have been added. Therefore, there is no account to delete, and the task cannot be completed from this UI."
}
```
