system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: The history of operations indicates that the user has navigated to the "Apps & notifications" section and then selected to see all apps installed on the device.

Step 2: On the current UI screen, the user needs to find the Google app to clear its cache and data. The available options are a search function, a more options menu, and a list of apps that can be scrolled through.

- "com.android.settings:id/search_app_list_menu" (id_1) would allow the user to search directly for the Google app, which is likely the most efficient way to locate the app.
- "More options" (id_2) could contain relevant actions, but it's less direct than searching for the app or scrolling through the list.
- Scrolling (id_3) through the list is another way to find the Google app, but it may be less efficient than using the search function, especially if the list is long.
- The apps listed (id_4 to id_12) are not the Google app, so interacting with any of these would not help complete the task.

Step 3: Based on the given task, the most likely action to be taken next is to use the search function to find the Google app. If the Google app is not immediately visible, the user may need to scroll through the list. The "More options" menu is less likely to be the correct next step but could still be relevant.

Here are the ratings:

- id_1 (Search): Since the search function could directly lead to the Google app, this is the most likely next step. Rating: 9.50
- id_2 (More options): This could contain additional actions, but it is not as directly related to the task as searching or scrolling. Rating: 4.50
- id_3 (Scroll): Scrolling may be necessary if the user does not use search or if the search does not yield the desired result. Rating: 7.00
- id_4 to id_12 (Listed apps): These do not include the Google app and are therefore not relevant to the task. Rating: 1.00

Step 4: Synthesizing the above information into a JSON object with scores:

```json
{
    "id_1": 9.50,
    "id_2": 4.50,
    "id_3": 7.00,
    "id_4": 1.00,
    "id_5": 1.00,
    "id_6": 1.00,
    "id_7": 1.00,
    "id_8": 1.00,
    "id_9": 1.00,
    "id_10": 1.00,
    "id_11": 1.00,
    "id_12": 1.00
}
```
