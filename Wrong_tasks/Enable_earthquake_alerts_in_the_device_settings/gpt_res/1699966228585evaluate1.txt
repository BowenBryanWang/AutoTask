system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.


user:
{
    "Task": "Clear the cache and data in Google.",
    "History operation sequence": [],
    "Current UI screen": "<scroll id=1 class=android.widget.ScrollView >\n    <div id=2   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Network & internet </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Wi\u2011Fi, mobile, data usage, and hotspot </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=3   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Connected devices </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Bluetooth </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=4   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Apps & notifications </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Recent apps, default apps </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=5   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Battery </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > 100% </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=6   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Display </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Wallpaper, sleep, font size </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=7   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Sound </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Volume, vibration, Do Not Disturb </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=8   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Storage </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > 26% used - 5.89 GB free </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=9   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Privacy </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Permissions, account activity, personal data </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=10   clickable>  </div>\n </scroll>\n",
    "Successive results": {}
}

Step 1: There is no history of operations, as the "History operation sequence" is empty. This is the first operation on this UI.

Step 2: To clear cache and data in Google, the user would typically need to navigate to the "Apps & notifications" settings where they can find the list of installed apps, select Google, and then clear cache and data. The UI elements presented do not directly mention "Google" or "cache," but we can infer the most likely path.

Step 3: Based on the task, the user should navigate to the "Apps & notifications" settings. Among the given options, "Apps & notifications" is the most relevant because it is where the user can manage app-specific settings, which includes clearing cache and data.

Step 4: Assigning scores based on relevance to the task:

- "Network & internet" (id_2) is not directly related to clearing app cache or data.
- "Connected devices" (id_3) is also not related to app management.
- "Apps & notifications" (id_4) is highly relevant because this is where app settings are managed.
- "Battery" (id_5) is not related to app management.
- "Display" (id_6) is not related to app management.
- "Sound" (id_7) is not related to app management.
- "Storage" (id_8) could be considered slightly relevant because it deals with storage, but it's not specific to app cache or data.
- "Privacy" (id_9) is not directly related to clearing cache or data for a specific app.
- <scroll> (id_1) should have a higher score than unrelated elements because there might be more options below that are not currently visible.

Here are the ratings:

{
    "id_1": 6.50, 
    "id_2": 1.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 10.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00, 
    "id_8": 2.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00
}

The highest score is for "id_4" which is the "Apps & notifications" option, as it is the most relevant to the task of clearing cache and data.
