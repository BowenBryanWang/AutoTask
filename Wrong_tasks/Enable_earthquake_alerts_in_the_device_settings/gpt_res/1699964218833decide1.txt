system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

Step 1:
The history ACTIONs indicate that the user has navigated through the settings menu to reach the "Network & internet" section, specifically to the Wi-Fi settings where the network 'AndroidWifi' is mentioned. The last action taken was to click on the 'Network & internet' settings, which led to the current UI page displaying Wi-Fi and other related settings. Since the task is to remove the saved network 'AndroidWifi', the last action is on the correct track as it has navigated the user to the page where Wi-Fi settings and presumably the options to manage saved networks are available.

Step 2:
The LATEST UI PAGE shows a clickable item with the description 'Wi‑Fi' and the name 'AndroidWifi' mentioned alongside a switch that is currently set to 'On'. This suggests that the network 'AndroidWifi' is currently active or connected. To fulfill the task of removing the saved network, the user would need to access the settings or options for 'AndroidWifi' where there should be an option to 'Forget' or 'Remove' the network. Since we see the network name and it is clickable, this suggests that further action can be taken on this element to potentially access more options related to the Wi-Fi network.

Step 3:
The elements on the current screen do not provide direct options to remove the network, but the clickable Wi-Fi network name 'AndroidWifi' suggests that there may be further UI elements that can be explored by clicking on it. There are no <scroll /> elements indicated, so we do not have information about whether the screen can be scrolled to reveal more options. However, the clickable nature of the Wi-Fi network name is a strong indication that further exploration is possible and appropriate for the task at hand.

Step 4:
Synthesizing the above thoughts, the conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

{
    "next ui element": "description='Wi‑Fi' clickable",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The user has navigated to the Wi-Fi settings where the network 'AndroidWifi' is listed. The element for 'AndroidWifi' is clickable, suggesting that further options to manage the network (including removal) may be accessible through this element."
