system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: The user has successfully navigated through the Privacy settings to the Permission manager. There have been no incorrect steps indicated in the history.

Step 2: On the current UI screen, the user is presented with a list of permission categories. Since the task is to enable location permission for Google Play services, the relevant UI element is the one associated with the 'Location' permission category.

Step 3: The user should click on the 'Location' category to proceed with managing location permissions for apps, including Google Play services.

Based on the provided hint and the task at hand, the 'Location' category is the next UI element to interact with.

Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

- The 'Body sensors' category (id_2) is not relevant to the task of enabling location permission.
- The 'Calendar' category (id_3) is not relevant to the task of enabling location permission.
- The 'Call logs' category (id_4) is not relevant to the task of enabling location permission.
- The 'Camera' category (id_5) is not relevant to the task of enabling location permission.
- The 'Contacts' category (id_6) is not relevant to the task of enabling location permission.
- The 'Files and media' category (id_7) is not relevant to the task of enabling location permission.
- The 'Location' category (id_8) is highly relevant and is the category that needs to be clicked on to enable location permission.
- The 'Microphone' category (id_9) is not relevant to the task of enabling location permission.
- The 'Phone' category (id_10) is not relevant to the task of enabling location permission.
- The <scroll/> element (id_1) should have a higher score than unrelated elements but lower than the 'Location' category since the user may need to scroll if the 'Location' category is not visible on the screen.
