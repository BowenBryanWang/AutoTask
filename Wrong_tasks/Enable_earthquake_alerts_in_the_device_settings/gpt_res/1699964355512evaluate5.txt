system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"FORGET\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'FORGET' button on the current UI page is the direct action needed to remove the saved network 'AndroidWifi', which is the user's task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", the user has navigated to the correct section of the settings where saved networks are listed and has selected the 'AndroidWifi' network. There are no steps indicating an error that caused navigation back.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen", the user is presented with options related to the 'AndroidWifi' network. The task is to remove the saved network 'AndroidWifi' from the device. The 'FORGET' button (id_2) is typically used to remove a saved network in Wi-Fi settings. The 'DISCONNECT' button (id_3) will only disconnect from the network but not remove it. 'SHARE' (id_4) and 'Advanced' (id_5) are unrelated to the task of removing the network. 'Modify' (id_1) is likely for changing network settings, not removing them.

Step 3: Based on the task to remove the saved network 'AndroidWifi', the 'FORGET' button (id_2) should be the next element to operate as it directly corresponds to the desired action.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above information, the JSON object with scores would be as follows:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 10.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 2.00
}

The 'FORGET' button (id_2) has the highest score as it is the direct action to complete the task. Other elements are scored lower due to their irrelevance to the task at hand.
