system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"Advanced\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'Advanced' section within the location settings may contain further settings related to emergency services, including earthquake alerts, which are part of the user's task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The user has already attempted to find the setting by scrolling through the list and clicking on what seemed to be related options such as "Advanced," but this did not yield the desired result and led to navigation back due to error. The task is to enable earthquake alerts in the device settings, which suggests that we need to look for a setting specifically related to emergency alerts or notifications.

Step 2: The "Successive results" for each UI option show that clicking on any of the elements id=1 through id=7 will lead to a similar screen with options like "Emergency Location Service," "Google Location Accuracy," "Google Location History," and "Google Location Sharing." None of these options directly mention earthquake alerts, but the "Advanced" section seems the most promising as it could contain additional settings related to emergency services, which may include earthquake alerts.

Step 3: Based on the hint provided, the "Advanced" section is the most likely place to find the earthquake alert setting. The user should click on the "Advanced" section to explore further options that might be hidden within this category. Since the user has already attempted this and navigated back due to an error, it's possible that the earthquake alert setting was missed or is not available on this path. However, given the hint and the fact that the "Advanced" section is the most relevant place to look for additional emergency service settings, it should be revisited.

Step 4: Scoring the elements based on their relevance to the task:

- id_1 represents the main switch for location services, which is already turned on and not directly related to earthquake alerts.
- id_3 to id_5 and id_7 do not seem directly related to the task at hand.
- id_6, which is the "Advanced" section, seems the most relevant based on the hint provided and the context of the task.

Given this analysis, here are the scores:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 2.00, 
    "id_5": 2.00, 
    "id_6": 9.00, 
    "id_7": 2.00
}

The "Advanced" section (id_6) should be clicked on next to look for the earthquake alert setting.
