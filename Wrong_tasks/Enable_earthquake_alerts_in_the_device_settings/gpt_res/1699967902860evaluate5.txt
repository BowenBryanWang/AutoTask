system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"scroll\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The last action taken by the user does not fulfill the task of enabling earthquake alerts. However, there is a scrollable area in the current UI that has not been fully explored, which might contain the setting for earthquake alerts. Therefore, the task is not yet completed, and it is not necessarily on the wrong track. The user should continue to explore the available settings by scrolling.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The history of operations indicates that the user has been interacting with various location-related settings and has been scrolling through options. No specific missteps are indicated that would have required a navigation back.

Step 2: The successive results for each UI element show that none of the clickable elements on the current screen directly relate to enabling earthquake alerts. They are mostly related to general location settings and permissions for apps and services. The hint suggests that the earthquake alert setting might be found by continuing to explore the scrollable area, which has not been fully explored.

Step 3: Based on the task of enabling earthquake alerts and the hint provided, the next logical step is to continue exploring the scrollable area for the relevant setting. None of the clickable items (id_4 to id_11) have been associated with the earthquake alert setting in the successive results. Therefore, the scroll action (id_3) should be the next operation to find the earthquake alert option.

Step 4: Synthesizing the information above, I will provide the following scores:

- id_1 (Location title): 1.00 (not an actionable item)
- id_2 (Use location switch): 1.00 (already on, not related to earthquake alerts)
- id_4 to id_11 (Clickable items for various location settings): 2.00 (minor relevance as they are related to location but not specifically to earthquake alerts)
- id_3 (Scroll action on the RecyclerView): 8.00 (higher relevance since it allows further exploration which is necessary to find the earthquake alert setting)

Outputting the scores in the requested format:

    "id_1": 1.00, 
    "id_2": 1.00,
