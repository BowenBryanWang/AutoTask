system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"com.android.settings:id/button1\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The cache has been successfully cleared, and the 'CLEAR STORAGE' button is available to clear user data, which is the next step in completing the task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the history, the user has navigated through the settings to the "Storage & cache" section of "Google Play services" and has successfully cleared the cache using the 'CLEAR CACHE' button.

Step 2: Successive results indicate that both 'CLEAR STORAGE' and 'CLEAR CACHE' buttons are still present, and the cache size is now 0 B, which means the previous operation to clear the cache was successful.

Step 3: The task is to clear the cache and data in Google. Since the cache has already been cleared, the next step is to clear the data. The 'CLEAR STORAGE' button (id=2) is the UI element that allows the user to clear user data.

Step 4: Based on the hint provided, which suggests that 'com.android.settings:id/button1' (which corresponds to 'CLEAR STORAGE') is the next UI element to operate, and considering that the cache has been cleared, the 'CLEAR STORAGE' button is the most relevant element for the next operation to complete the task.

Therefore, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:

{
    "id_1": 1.00,  // The header is not an interactive element for this task.
    "id_2": 10.00, // 'CLEAR STORAGE' is the next step to clear data.
    "id_3": 1.00   // 'CLEAR CACHE' has already been used and is not needed again.
