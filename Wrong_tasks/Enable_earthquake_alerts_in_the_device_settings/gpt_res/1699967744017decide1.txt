system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

===response===
Step 1:
The user's task is to enable earthquake alerts in the device settings. The history of actions shows that the user has scrolled through various settings categories such as Battery, Display, Sound, Storage, Privacy, Location, Security, Accounts, Accessibility, Google, and System. The last action taken was to scroll forward on an android.widget.ScrollView, which suggests that the user is navigating through the settings menu to find the appropriate setting for enabling earthquake alerts.

Step 2:
The latest UI page shows a scrollable view with various settings categories, including Sound, Storage, Privacy, Location, Security, Accounts, Accessibility, Google, and System. None of these categories explicitly mention earthquake alerts. However, the category that could potentially contain earthquake alert settings would be either Location (since earthquake alerts are location-based) or System (as it might include emergency alert settings). Since the task is to enable earthquake alerts, the user may need to explore these categories further to find the specific setting.

Step 3:
The current UI elements that are generally worth exploring include the clickable elements for Location and System, as they could potentially lead to the setting for earthquake alerts. Moreover, since there is a scroll element present, it indicates that there may be more elements below that are not currently visible on the screen. Therefore, scrolling could reveal additional settings that might include the earthquake alert option.

Step 4:
Synthesizing the above thoughts, the conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

{
    "next ui element": "Location or System (or scroll for more options)",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The last action of scrolling brought the user to a page with settings that could contain the earthquake alert option. The user should explore the Location and System settings further or scroll to reveal more options that might include the desired setting."
