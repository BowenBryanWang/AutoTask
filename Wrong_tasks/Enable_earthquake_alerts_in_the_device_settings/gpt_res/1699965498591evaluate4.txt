system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"SHARE\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'SHARE' button on the current UI page is the next step to generate a QR code for sharing the Wi-Fi information, which aligns with the user's task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the history operation sequence, the user has navigated through the settings to the Wi-Fi section and selected the 'AndroidWifi' network, which is currently connected. There are no indications of wrong steps that have caused navigation back.

Step 2: On the current UI screen, the task is to share Wi-Fi information using a QR code. The "SHARE" button (id_4) seems to be the most relevant element for this task as it suggests a sharing functionality, which is typically used to share information in various forms, including QR codes.

The "Modify" element (id_1) might be related to changing settings of the Wi-Fi network rather than sharing its information. The "FORGET" (id_2) and "DISCONNECT" (id_3) buttons are operations that are not relevant to the sharing task. The "Advanced" section (id_5) may contain additional settings or information but does not directly imply a sharing function.

Step 3: Based on the given hint and the analysis of the UI elements, the "SHARE" button (id_4) should be the next element to operate in order to complete the task of sharing Wi-Fi information via a QR code.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above reasoning, the JSON object with scores would be:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 1.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 10.00, 
    "id_5": 3.00
}

The "SHARE" button (id_4) receives the highest score as it is directly related to the task. The "Modify" element (id_1) and the "Advanced" section (id_5) have minor relevance but are not the primary actions for sharing. The "FORGET" (id_2) and "DISCONNECT" (id_3) buttons are not relevant to the task at hand.
