system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Successive results": {},
    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"description='Wi\\u2011Fi' clickable\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The user has navigated to the Wi-Fi settings where the network 'AndroidWifi' is listed. The element for 'AndroidWifi' is clickable, suggesting that further options to manage the network (including removal) may be accessible through this element.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The history shows that the user has clicked on the "Network & internet" settings where Wi-Fi, mobile, data usage, and hotspot settings can be accessed. There is no indication of a wrong step that caused a navigate back.

Step 2: Based on the current UI screen, the user needs to access Wi-Fi settings to manage saved networks. The "Wi-Fi" element with the description "AndroidWifi" is clickable, which suggests that it may lead to the Wi-Fi settings where networks can be managed. The hint provided by another model also suggests that clicking on the Wi-Fi element is the correct next step to manage networks, including removing the 'AndroidWifi' network.

Step 3: The user should click on the Wi-Fi settings to proceed with the task of removing the saved network 'AndroidWifi'. The clickable Wi-Fi element with the description 'AndroidWifi' is the most relevant to the task at hand. Other elements like "Mobile network," "Airplane mode," "Mobile plan," "Hotspot & tethering," and "Advanced" are not directly related to the task of removing a saved Wi-Fi network.

Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

{
    "id_1": 9.00,  // Clickable Wi-Fi settings with 'AndroidWifi' mentioned, highly relevant to the task.
    "id_2": 1.00,  // Wi-Fi switch, not relevant to removing a specific network.
    "id_3": 1.00,  // Mobile network settings, not relevant to Wi-Fi management.
    "id_4": 1.00,  // Airplane mode settings, not relevant to Wi-Fi management.
    "id_5": 1.00,  // Airplane mode switch, not relevant to Wi-Fi management.
    "id_6": 1.00,  // Mobile plan settings, not relevant to Wi-Fi management.
    "id_7": 1.00,  // Hotspot & tethering settings, not relevant to Wi-Fi management.
    "id_8": 1.00   // Advanced settings, less likely to be relevant to the specific task of removing a saved Wi-Fi network.
