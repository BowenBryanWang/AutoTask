system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no history of operations, as the "History operation sequence" is empty. This means we are starting with a fresh task.

Step 2: The task is to enable earthquake alerts in the device settings. On the current UI screen, there are several options related to device settings, but none of them directly mention earthquake alerts. We should look for a setting that is most likely related to alerts, notifications, or emergency broadcasts. 

- "Battery", "Display", "Sound", "Storage", "Accounts", "Accessibility", and "Google" are not directly related to earthquake alerts.
- "Privacy" might be slightly relevant, as it deals with personal data, but it's unlikely to contain alert settings.
- "Location" could be relevant since earthquake alerts might be location-based, but it's more likely related to general location settings.
- "Security" might contain emergency settings, but it's typically more focused on device security rather than alerts.

Since none of the visible options directly relate to earthquake alerts, and there is a possibility that the relevant setting might be further down in the list, the <scroll> element should be given a higher score to explore more options.

Step 3: The next operation should be to scroll to find more settings that could contain the earthquake alert option.

Step 4: Synthesize the ratings:

- "Battery", "Display", "Sound", "Storage", "Accounts", "Accessibility", and "Google" are not related to the task, so they get a low score.
- "Privacy" has a minor relevance, but it's unlikely to contain the alert settings, so it gets a slightly higher score than the unrelated ones.
- "Location" and "Security" could be somewhat relevant, so they get a slightly higher score than "Privacy".
- The <scroll> element gets the highest score as it's our method to explore more options that could contain the earthquake alert settings.

Here are the scores:

{
    "id_1": 7.50,
    "id_2": 2.00,
    "id_3": 2.00,
    "id_4": 2.00,
    "id_5": 2.00,
    "id_6": 3.00,
    "id_7": 4.00,
    "id_8": 4.00,
    "id_9": 2.00,
    "id_10": 2.00,
    "id_11": 2.00
