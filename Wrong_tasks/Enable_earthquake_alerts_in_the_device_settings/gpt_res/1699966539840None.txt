the following string cannot be parsed to a dict (or list) by the built-in function eval (in Python) due to the error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 2).

{
    "id_1": 1.00,  // The header is not an interactive element for this task.
    "id_2": 10.00, // 'CLEAR STORAGE' is the next step to clear data.
    "id_3": 1.00   // 'CLEAR CACHE' has already been used and is not needed again.

Please correct its format error and output the correct string. Do not output anything else.
