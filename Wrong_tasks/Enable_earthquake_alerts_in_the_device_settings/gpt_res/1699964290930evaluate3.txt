system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," we can see that the user has accessed the "Network & internet" settings and then clicked on "Wi-Fi," where they see the "AndroidWifi" network is connected. There is no indication of a wrong step that caused a navigate back.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen," we have several elements:
- id_1: The Wi-Fi switch bar, which is not directly related to removing a network.
- id_2: The switch to toggle Wi-Fi on or off, which doesn't remove a network.
- id_3: A scrollable list that likely contains network-related options.
- id_4: The "AndroidWifi" network, which may lead to network details but not necessarily to removal options.
- id_5: An option to "Add network," which is unrelated to removal.
- id_6: A button to scan a QR code, which is also unrelated.
- id_7: "Wi-Fi preferences," which is not directly related to removing a network.
- id_8: "Saved networks," which is likely where one would manage or remove saved networks.
- id_9: "Wi-Fi data usage," which is not related to network removal.

Step 3: To remove the saved network 'AndroidWifi' from the device, the user must navigate to where they can manage saved networks. The hint suggests that clicking on "Saved networks" is the correct next step, which aligns with the expected user flow for removing a network.

Step 4: Scoring the elements based on their relevance to the task:
- id_1 and id_2 are related to Wi-Fi settings but not to network management, so they receive lower scores.
- id_3 is a scrollable list that may contain relevant options, so it gets a medium score in case we need to explore further.
- id_4 is the network itself, which might lead to details but not directly to removal, so it gets a medium score.
- id_5, id_6, and id_9 are unrelated to removal, so they receive the lowest scores.
- id_7 is related to Wi-Fi preferences, which is not the target, so it receives a low score.
- id_8 is the direct path to manage and remove networks, so it receives the highest score.

Here are the scores for each UI element:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 5.00, 
    "id_4": 4.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 2.00, 
    "id_8": 10.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00
}
