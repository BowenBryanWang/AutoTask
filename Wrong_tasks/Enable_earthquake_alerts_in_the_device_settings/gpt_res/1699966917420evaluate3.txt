system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", the user has been scrolling through the settings menu, likely looking for the option to turn on severe threats in wireless emergency alerts. There have been no wrong steps that led to a navigate back, so the user is presumably still searching for the right option.

Step 2: The "Successive Results" suggest that the current UI screen contains various settings options, none of which directly relate to wireless emergency alerts. The options include Storage, Privacy, Location, Security, Accounts, Accessibility, Google, System, and About emulated device.

Step 3: To complete the task of turning on severe threats in wireless emergency alerts, the user needs to find the specific setting related to emergency alerts. None of the options listed on the current screen directly indicate that they would contain the emergency alerts settings. Therefore, the user should continue to scroll to explore more options that might be further down in the list.

Step 4: Given that the task at hand is to find a specific setting and none of the currently visible options are relevant, the best course of action is to continue scrolling. The hint provided by another model also suggests scrolling to find the correct setting.

The rating for each UI element is as follows:

- id_1 (scroll): 10.00 - The scroll element is the most likely candidate for the next operation as it allows the user to continue exploring the settings.
- id_2 to id_11 (various settings options): 1.00 - None of these options are relevant to the task of finding the emergency alerts settings, so they receive the lowest score.

The synthesized output is:

{
    "id_1": 10.00,
    "id_2": 1.00,
    "id_3": 1.00,
    "id_4": 1.00,
    "id_5": 1.00,
    "id_6": 1.00,
    "id_7": 1.00,
    "id_8": 1.00,
    "id_9": 1.00,
    "id_10": 1.00,
    "id_11": 1.00
