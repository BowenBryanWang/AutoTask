system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The task is to enable earthquake alerts, and while the current UI elements do not directly mention this feature, there is a scrollable area that could contain additional settings related to location services where the option to enable earthquake alerts might be found.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it appears that the user has been navigating through location-related settings, but there has been no indication of an incorrect operation that required a navigate back action.

Step 2: The "Successive Results" show that all clickable items on the current screen pertain to location settings, but none directly mention earthquake alerts. Since the task is to enable earthquake alerts and given the hint that suggests continuing to explore the scrollable area, we should focus on elements within the scrollable RecyclerView that could lead to more specific settings.

Step 3: To proceed, the user should continue to explore the scrollable area for additional settings related to location services, as the earthquake alert option might be found there. Since none of the items directly mention earthquake alerts, the scroll action seems to be the most appropriate next step.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above steps, here is the output with scores:

- "id_1" represents the switch bar to turn location services on or off, which is already on. Since the task is not to toggle location services, it is not the next operation. However, it is contextually relevant, so it should not have the lowest score.
- "id_2" is the switch itself, which is also not the next operation for the same reason as "id_1".
- "id_3" is the scrollable RecyclerView, which is the most likely candidate for the next operation as it may reveal additional settings, including potentially the earthquake alert setting.
- "id_4" to "id_10" are clickable items within the RecyclerView, but none of these items seem to lead directly to enabling earthquake alerts based on their descriptions.
- "id_11" is a description of location sources and does not offer a direct action.

Given this analysis, here is the JSON object with scores:

{
    "id_1": 2.50, 
    "id_2": 2.50, 
    "id_3": 9.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00,
