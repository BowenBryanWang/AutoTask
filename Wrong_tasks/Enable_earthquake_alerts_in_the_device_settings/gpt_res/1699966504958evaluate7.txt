system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"CLEAR CACHE or CLEAR STORAGE\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The user has navigated to the 'Storage' screen for Google Play services, where they can clear the cache and data to fulfill the task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it seems the user has navigated through the settings to reach the Google Play services 'Storage & cache' screen. No incorrect steps have been reported, and the user has not navigated back from any wrong operation.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen," the user is presented with options to clear storage and cache for Google Play services. Since the task is to clear the cache and data in Google, there are two relevant buttons: "CLEAR STORAGE" and "CLEAR CACHE." There are no successive results provided, but based on the task and the hint from another model, both of these buttons are directly related to the user's goal.

Step 3: The next steps should be to first clear the cache and then clear the storage, as these actions will fulfill the task of clearing both cache and data for Google.

Based on the above steps, the ratings for the UI elements are as follows:

- "CLEAR CACHE" is directly related to the task and should be the first operation since it's a less drastic action compared to clearing all storage. It is also part of the task to clear the cache.
- "CLEAR STORAGE" is also directly related to the task, but it is a more drastic action that will clear all data, including the cache. It should be performed after clearing the cache if the user's intention is to clear all data.

Here are the scores for the UI elements:

{
    "id_2": 9.50, // CLEAR STORAGE is highly relevant but should be the second step.
    "id_3": 10.00 // CLEAR CACHE is the most relevant and should be the first step.
}

The scores reflect that both buttons are highly relevant to the task, but "CLEAR CACHE" should be operated first followed by "CLEAR STORAGE."
