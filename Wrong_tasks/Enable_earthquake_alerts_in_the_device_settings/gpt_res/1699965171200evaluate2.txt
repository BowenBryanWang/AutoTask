system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.


user:
{
    "Task": "Allow emergency broadcast alerts on the phone.",
    "History operation sequence": [
        "Click on clickable 'android:id/title' Apps & notifications 'android:id/summary' Recent apps, default apps"
    ],
    "Current UI screen": "<p class=''  > Apps & notifications </p>\n<p class='com.android.settings:id/header_title'  > Recently opened apps </p>\n<div id=1 class='com.android.settings:id/app1_view'  clickable> \n    <p class='com.android.settings:id/app_title'  > WebView Shell </p>\n\n    <p class='com.android.settings:id/app_summary'  > 16 min. ago </p>\n </div>\n<div id=2 class='com.android.settings:id/app2_view'  clickable> \n    <p class='com.android.settings:id/app_title'  > ActionRecord </p>\n\n    <p class='com.android.settings:id/app_summary'  > 3 hr. ago </p>\n </div>\n<button id=3 class='com.android.settings:id/header_details'  > SEE ALL 18 APPS </button>\n<div id=4   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Conversations </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > No priority conversations </p>\n </div>\n<div id=5   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Notifications </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Notification history, bubbles, recently sent </p>\n </div>\n<div id=6   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Default apps </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > WebView Shell, Phone, and Messaging </p>\n </div>\n<div id=7   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Advanced </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Permission manager, Wireless emergency alerts, Special app access </p>\n </div>\n",
    "Successive results": {},
    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"Advanced 'android:id/title' Wireless emergency alerts\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'Advanced' section on the current UI page mentions 'Wireless emergency alerts,' indicating that the user can proceed by clicking this option to potentially enable emergency broadcast alerts.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The history shows that the user has clicked on "Apps & notifications" which is a relevant category but not specific to the task of enabling emergency broadcast alerts.

Step 2: Analyzing the current UI screen, there are several clickable elements, but based on the hint provided, the "Advanced" section is the most relevant as it mentions "Wireless emergency alerts". Since the task is to allow emergency broadcast alerts, this is likely where the setting would be found. The other elements such as "Recently opened apps", "Conversations", "Notifications", and "Default apps" are less relevant to the task at hand.

Step 3: The next step should be to click on the "Advanced" section to navigate to the settings where emergency broadcast alerts can be enabled.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above information, I will output the JSON object with scores:

- "id_1" and "id_2" represent recently opened apps, which are not relevant to the task (low score).
- "id_3" is a button to see all apps, which is not directly related to the task (low score).
- "id_4" and "id_6" are related to conversations and default apps settings, which are not relevant to the task (low score).
- "id_5" is related to notifications but does not specifically mention emergency alerts (medium-low score).
- "id_7" directly mentions "Wireless emergency alerts" in the summary, which is highly relevant to the task (high score).

Here is the JSON object with the scores:

{
    "id_1": 1.00, 
    "id_2": 1.00, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 3.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 9.00
}
