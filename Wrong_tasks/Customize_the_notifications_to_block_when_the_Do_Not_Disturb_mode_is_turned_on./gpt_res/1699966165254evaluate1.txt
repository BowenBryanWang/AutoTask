system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: Reviewing the ["History operation sequence"], we can see that there have been multiple attempts to click on an "Accounts" option with the summary "No accounts added," which led to errors and navigating back. It's likely that the "Accounts" section did not contain the user "Alice" or any accounts at all, hence the errors.

Step 2: Analyzing the ["Successive Results"] after scrolling, we find various system settings options. The task is to delete a guest user named Alice from the device. Typically, user accounts are managed within the "Accounts" or "Users & accounts" settings on an Android device. The provided successive results show an "Accounts" option with the summary "No accounts added," which implies that there might be more options available after scrolling that are not yet visible on the current UI screen.

Step 3: Deciding what should be done next, we need to find the appropriate section where guest users can be managed. Since the "Accounts" option previously led to errors, and considering that the task is to delete a user, we should look for a "Users" or "Users & accounts" option. The current UI screen does not show such an option, so we should continue to scroll to reveal more options.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output, the score for the scroll action should be high as it is likely to reveal the relevant "Users" or "Users & accounts" section where we can manage and delete a guest user named Alice. None of the currently visible options directly relate to the task of deleting a user, so their scores will be low.

Here are the ratings for the UI elements based on their relevance to the task:

{
    "id_1": 8.50,  // Scrolling is likely to reveal more options, possibly including "Users" or "Users & accounts".
    "id_2": 1.00,  // "Network & internet" is not related to user management.
    "id_3": 1.00,  // "Connected devices" is not related to user management.
    "id_4": 1.00,  // "Apps & notifications" is not related to user account deletion.
    "id_5": 1.00,  // "Battery" is not related to user management.
    "id_6": 1.00,  // "Display" is not related to user management.
    "id_7": 1.00,  // "Sound" is not related to user management.
    "id_8": 1.00,  // "Storage" is not related to user management.
    "id_9": 1.00   // "Privacy" is not directly related to managing or deleting users.
