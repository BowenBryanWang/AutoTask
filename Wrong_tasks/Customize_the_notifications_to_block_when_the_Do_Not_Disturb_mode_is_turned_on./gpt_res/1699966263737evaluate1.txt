system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no history of operation sequences, so we are starting fresh with no prior mistakes to consider.

Step 2: Based on the task to "Remove the saved network 'AndroidWifi' from the device," we need to navigate to the Wi-Fi settings where we can manage network connections. Among the options presented, "Network & internet" is the most relevant as it includes Wi-Fi settings.

Step 3: The next step should be to click on the "Network & internet" option to proceed to where we can find and remove the saved network. The other options are not directly related to the task of managing Wi-Fi networks.

Here are the ratings based on the relevance to the task:

- "Network & internet" is the section where Wi-Fi settings are typically found.
- "Connected devices" relates to Bluetooth and other device connections, not Wi-Fi networks.
- "Apps & notifications" is about app settings and notification preferences.
- "Battery" displays information about the battery, not network settings.
- "Display" is for visual settings of the device.
- "Sound" is for audio settings.
- "Storage" is for managing the device's storage.
- "Privacy" is for permissions and personal data settings.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above, the JSON object with scores would be:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 9.50, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00, 
    "id_8": 1.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00
}
