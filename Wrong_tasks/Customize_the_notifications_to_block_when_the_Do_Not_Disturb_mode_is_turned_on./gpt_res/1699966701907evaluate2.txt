system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.


user:
{
    "Task": "Remove the saved network 'AndroidWifi' from the device",
    "History operation sequence": [
        "Click on clickable 'android:id/title' Network & internet 'android:id/summary' Wi\u2011Fi, mobile, data usage, and hotspot"
    ],
    "Current UI screen": "<p class=''  > Network & internet </p>\n<div id=1  description='Wi\u2011Fi' clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Wi\u2011Fi </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > AndroidWifi / No internet </p>\n\n    <switch id=2 class='com.android.settings:id/switchWidget' clickable > On </switch>\n </div>\n<div id=3   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Mobile network </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > T-Mobile </p>\n </div>\n<div id=4   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Airplane mode </p>\n\n    <switch id=5 class='android:id/switch_widget' clickable > Off </switch>\n </div>\n<div id=6   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Mobile plan </p>\n </div>\n<div id=7   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Hotspot & tethering </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Tethering </p>\n </div>\n<div id=8   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Advanced </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Data Saver, VPN, Private DNS </p>\n </div>\n",
    "Successive results": {},
    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"Wi\\u2011Fi section\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The user has navigated to the Wi-Fi settings and the 'AndroidWifi' network is visible. The Wi-Fi section is clickable and likely leads to further options where the network can be managed and removed.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The user has already navigated to the "Network & internet" settings page, as indicated by the history of operations. There is no mention of any wrong steps that led to a navigation back.

Step 2: On the current UI screen, the user needs to find and remove the saved network 'AndroidWifi'. The hint suggests that the next step should be to enter the Wi-Fi section to manage networks.

Step 3: The next logical step is to click on the Wi-Fi section to access the Wi-Fi settings where the user can manage and remove networks. The clickable Wi-Fi section with the description 'AndroidWifi / No internet' is the most relevant UI element for this task.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above information, the clickable Wi-Fi section with id 1 is the most relevant and should receive the highest score. The switch for Wi-Fi (id 2) is also relevant because it indicates whether Wi-Fi is on or off, which is necessary for managing networks but not as directly related to the task as accessing the Wi-Fi settings. The other elements on the screen (id 3, id 4, id 5, id 6, id 7, id 8) are not directly related to the task of removing a saved network and should receive lower scores.

Based on this analysis, the JSON object with the scores would be:

{
    "id_1": 9.50, "id_2": 6.00, "id_3": 2.00, "id_4": 2.00, "id_5": 2.00, "id_6": 2.00, "id_7": 2.00, "id_8": 2.00
}
