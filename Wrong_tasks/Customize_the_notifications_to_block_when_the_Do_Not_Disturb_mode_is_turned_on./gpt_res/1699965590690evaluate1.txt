system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

{
    "Task": "Delete a guest user named Alice from the device.",
    "History operation sequence": [],
    "Current UI screen": "<scroll id=1 class=android.widget.ScrollView >\n    <div id=2   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Network & internet </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Wi\u2011Fi, mobile, data usage, and hotspot </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=3   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Connected devices </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Bluetooth, Android Auto </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=4   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Apps & notifications </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Recent apps, default apps </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=5   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Battery </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > 100% </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=6   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Display </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Wallpaper, sleep, font size </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=7   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Sound </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Volume, vibration, Do Not Disturb </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=8   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Storage </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > 28% used - 5.75 GB free </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=9   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Privacy </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Permissions, account activity, personal data </p>\n </div>\n </scroll>\n",
    "Successive results": {}
}

Step 1: There are no previous operations to consider as the "History operation sequence" is empty.

Step 2: Looking at the "Current UI screen", we need to find an entry point to manage users on the device. The task is to delete a guest user named Alice, so we should look for a settings category that relates to user accounts or user management.

Step 3: The most likely path to managing users would be through a setting related to accounts or users. None of the visible options explicitly mention users or accounts, but the "Privacy" setting could potentially lead to user account settings. However, it is more common for user management to be found in a "Users & accounts" or "System" section. Since these options are not visible, we may need to scroll to find the correct option.

Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores. Since none of the visible options are directly related to user management, but "Privacy" could be somewhat related, it will receive a lower score. The scroll action will receive a higher score as it is likely we need to find the correct section by scrolling.
