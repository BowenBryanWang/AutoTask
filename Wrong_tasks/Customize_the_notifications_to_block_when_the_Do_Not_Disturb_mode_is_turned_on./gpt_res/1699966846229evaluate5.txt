system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," the user has navigated through the settings to reach the specific network 'AndroidWifi' they wish to remove. There are no indications of incorrect steps that led to a need to navigate back.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen," the user is presented with several options related to the 'AndroidWifi' network. The task is to remove the saved network 'AndroidWifi' from the device. The elements available are:
- Modify (id_1)
- Forget (id_2)
- Disconnect (id_3)
- Share (id_4)
- Advanced (id_5)

The "Forget" button (id_2) is the most relevant to the task as it would remove the saved network from the device. The other buttons and elements do not directly relate to the task of removing the network.

Step 3: The next step should be to operate the "Forget" button, as it is the action that will directly achieve the user's goal of removing the saved network.

Step 4: Based on the relevance to the task, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:
- Modify is not directly related to removing the network but could be part of a settings change, so it gets a lower score.
- Forget is the direct action required to complete the task.
- Disconnect might be confused with removing the network but it does not delete the network, it just disconnects from it.
- Share is unrelated to removing the network.
- Advanced might contain additional settings but is not the direct action for removing the network.
