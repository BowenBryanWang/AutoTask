system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Task": "Customize the notifications to block when the Do Not Disturb mode is turned on.",
    "History operation sequence": [

    "Successive results": {},
    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"Add apps\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The user is in the 'Apps' section where they can manage apps for Do Not Disturb mode, and the 'Add apps' element is the next step to customize notifications as required by the task.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The history of operations indicates that the user has navigated to the "Do Not Disturb" settings and then to the "Apps" section where they can manage which apps can interrupt during Do Not Disturb mode.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows three clickable elements:
- Digital Wellbeing: This seems to be an app that is currently allowed to interrupt during Do Not Disturb mode.
- Add apps: This option is likely where the user can add more apps to the list of exceptions.
- Selected people can still reach you: This seems to be a setting related to allowing calls or messages from selected contacts, not apps.

Given the task to "Customize the notifications to block when the Do Not Disturb mode is turned on," the most relevant option seems to be "Add apps" because it directly relates to managing app notifications during Do Not Disturb mode.

Step 3: The hint confirms that "Add apps" is the correct next step to customize notifications as required by the task.

Based on the above steps, the JSON object with scores would be:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, "id_2": 9.50, "id_3": 2.00
}

"id_1" is rated low because it's specific to the Digital Wellbeing app and does not represent a general setting for all apps. "id_2" is rated high as it is the direct next step for adding apps to the Do Not Disturb exception list. "id_3" is rated low because it pertains to people, not apps, and is therefore less relevant to the task of customizing notifications from apps.
