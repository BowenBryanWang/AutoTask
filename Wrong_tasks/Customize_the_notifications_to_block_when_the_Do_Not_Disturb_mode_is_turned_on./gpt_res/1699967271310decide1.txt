system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

Step 1:
The user's task is to customize the notifications to block when the Do Not Disturb mode is turned on. The history of actions shows that the user has navigated from the main settings page to the Sound settings page by clicking on the option that includes "Volume, vibration, Do Not Disturb". This indicates that the user is on the correct path to accessing the Do Not Disturb settings, which is where they would be able to customize the notifications.

Step 2:
The latest UI page shows the Sound settings with various options, including "Media volume", "Call volume", "Ring & notification volume", "Alarm volume", "Vibrate for calls", "Do Not Disturb", "Media", and "Shortcut to prevent ringing". Among these options, the clickable "Do Not Disturb" section is the most relevant to the user's task. Since the summary text for "Do Not Disturb" mentions that it is currently "Off / 3 schedules can turn on automatically", it indicates that further interaction with this element could lead to the customization options for Do Not Disturb mode, where the user can potentially block specific notifications.

Step 3:
There are no other elements with general purposes that need to be explored for this specific task, other than the "Do Not Disturb" section. The presence of a "<scroll />" element suggests that there might be more options available off-screen, but since the "Do Not Disturb" option is already visible and directly related to the task, it is not necessary to scroll further at this point.

Step 4:
Based on the above reasoning, the user is on the right track to complete their task. They should now click on the "Do Not Disturb" option to proceed with customizing the notifications to block when Do Not Disturb mode is turned on. Therefore, the status is "go on" with the next UI element being the "Do Not Disturb" option to be operated on.

The conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

```json
{
    "next ui element": "clickable 'android:id/title' Do Not Disturb 'android:id/summary' Off / 3 schedules can turn on automatically",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The 'Do Not Disturb' option in the Sound settings is directly related to the user's task and can be operated on to customize the notifications to block when the Do Not Disturb mode is turned on."
}
