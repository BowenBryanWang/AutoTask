system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", the user has navigated to the Wi-Fi settings by clicking on the "Network & internet" and then on "Wi-Fi". There are no incorrect steps that have led to a navigate back action.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen", to remove a saved network, the user would typically need to navigate to the list of saved networks. The network 'AndroidWifi' is mentioned on the screen, but it does not provide an option to remove it directly from this page. The user needs to find the option that leads to managing saved networks.

Step 3: Based on the hint provided, the "Saved networks" option is the correct path to take to reach the list of saved networks, where the user can then proceed to remove 'AndroidWifi'. The clickable 'android:id/title' Saved networks 'android:id/summary' 1 network seems to be the next logical step in the task.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output, the JSON object with scores is as follows:

- The switch for Wi-Fi (id_2) does not directly relate to removing a network, so it has a lower relevance.
- The list of networks (scroll id_3) could potentially contain more options, but since we have a direct hint to click on "Saved networks", it has a lower priority.
- The clickable "Saved networks" (id_8) is the most relevant to the task at hand as per the hint provided.

The scores for each UI element are:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 6.00, 
    "id_4": 2.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 2.00, 
    "id_8": 10.00, 
    "id_9": 2.00
}

"id_8" has the highest score as it is the direct next step towards completing the task.
