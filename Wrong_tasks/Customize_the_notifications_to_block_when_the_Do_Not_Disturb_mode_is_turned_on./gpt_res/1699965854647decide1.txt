system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

NOTE in this History Pages and Action Dict format:
1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

Step 1:
The user's task is to delete a guest user named Alice from the device. The history of actions shows that the user has been scrolling through the settings menu, specifically through the sections such as "Network & internet," "Connected devices," "Apps & notifications," and others. The last action taken was a scroll forward on an android.widget.ScrollView, which suggests that the user is navigating through the settings to find the appropriate section to manage users.

Step 2:
The latest UI page shows a scrollable view with various settings options, including "Storage," "Privacy," "Location," "Security," "Accounts," "Accessibility," "Digital Wellbeing & parental controls," "Google," and "System." To complete the task of deleting a guest user named Alice, the user needs to find the section related to user accounts or user management. The option labeled "Accounts" with the summary "No accounts added" seems to be the most relevant to the task at hand as it typically includes options for managing user accounts on the device.

Step 3:
On the current screen, the element with the title "Accounts" is worth exploring further as it is generally where user account management options are found in device settings. Since we have a scrollable view indicated by "<scroll />," there may be more elements below that are not currently visible on the screen. If the "Accounts" section does not lead to the user management options, it may be necessary to scroll further to find additional settings that could pertain to guest user management.

Step 4:
Synthesizing the above thoughts, the conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

{
    "next ui element": "'android:id/title' Accounts",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The 'Accounts' section in the settings menu is typically where user management options are found, and since the task is to delete a guest user, this section is the next logical step in the UI task sequence. The presence of a scrollable view also suggests that there may be more options available that could potentially lead to the completion of the task."
