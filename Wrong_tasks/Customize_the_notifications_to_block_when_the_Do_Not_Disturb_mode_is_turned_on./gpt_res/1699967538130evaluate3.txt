system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

Step 1: The history of operations shows that the user has navigated to the Do Not Disturb settings and is currently at the right place to adjust the Do Not Disturb mode settings.

Step 2: Based on the current UI screen, there are several clickable elements related to Do Not Disturb settings. Since the task is to customize notifications to block when the Do Not Disturb mode is turned on, the elements that are most likely to contain these settings are "People", "Apps", "Alarms & other interruptions", "Schedules", and "Advanced".

- "Turn on now" is a button to activate Do Not Disturb mode but does not offer customization of notifications, so it is not immediately relevant to the task.
- "People" might allow the user to specify which contacts can interrupt, but it does not directly relate to blocking notifications.
- "Apps" seems to be the most relevant since it directly mentions an app (Digital Wellbeing) that can interrupt, implying that this is where app notification settings can be customized.
- "Alarms & other interruptions" could be relevant for allowing alarms through but is less likely to be where notification blocking settings are found.
- "Schedules" is related to setting times when Do Not Disturb activates, not the customization of which notifications are blocked.
- "Advanced" could contain additional settings but is less specific than "Apps".

Given the hint that the clickable element "Apps" is the correct path to customize the notifications to be blocked when DND is on, this aligns with the logical deduction from the UI elements.

Step 3: To proceed with the task, the user should click on the element related to "Apps" to explore the settings for which app notifications can be blocked during Do Not Disturb mode.

Step 4: Scoring the UI elements based on their relevance to the task:

- "Turn on now" is not directly related to the customization of notifications, so it gets a lower score.
- "People" is somewhat relevant but not the most likely place to block notifications, so it gets a medium score.
- "Apps" is the most relevant based on the hint and the task, so it gets the highest score.
- "Alarms & other interruptions" is somewhat relevant but less likely than "Apps", so it gets a medium score.
- "Schedules" is related to the activation of Do Not Disturb but not to the customization of notifications, so it gets a lower score.
- "Advanced" could be relevant but is vague, so it gets a medium score.

Here are the scores for each element:

{
    "id_1": 3.50, 
    "id_2": 6.00, 
    "id_3": 10.00, 
    "id_4": 6.00, 
    "id_5": 3.50, 
    "id_6": 6.00
