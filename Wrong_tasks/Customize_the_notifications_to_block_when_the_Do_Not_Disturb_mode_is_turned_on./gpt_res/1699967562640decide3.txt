system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

Step 1:
The user's task is to customize the notifications to block when the Do Not Disturb mode is turned on. The history of actions shows that the user navigated through the settings, specifically going into 'Sound' settings, then into 'Do Not Disturb' settings, and finally into a page where they can control which 'Apps' can interrupt during Do Not Disturb mode. The last action taken by the user was to navigate into the 'Apps' section where they can specify which apps can send notifications during Do Not Disturb mode. This action is on the right track as it involves specifying the behavior of notifications during Do Not Disturb mode.

Step 2:
The latest UI page shows elements that include 'Digital Wellbeing', 'Add apps', and an option that indicates 'Selected people can still reach you, even if you don’t allow apps to interrupt'. This page is where the user can potentially add or remove apps for the Do Not Disturb mode, which is directly related to the task of customizing notifications during this mode. Since the user is already in the section where they can add apps that can interrupt, this UI can further lead to the task fulfillment.

Step 3:
On the current page, there are clickable elements such as 'Digital Wellbeing', 'Add apps', and a section related to allowing selected people to reach the user. Since the task involves customizing the notifications to block when Do Not Disturb is on, the element 'Add apps' is particularly relevant as it suggests the user can add more apps to the list that can interrupt, or by inference, customize which apps are blocked. This element is worth exploring further to complete the task, and there is no indication that the user needs to navigate back. No <scroll /> elements are present, which means we do not have any additional off-screen elements to consider at this time.

Step 4:
Synthesizing the above steps, the user is on the correct path to fulfilling the task by being in the 'Apps' section where they can add or manage the apps that can send notifications during Do Not Disturb mode. The 'Add apps' element is the next logical UI element to operate on to continue with the task fulfillment.

The conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

```json
{
    "next ui element": "Add apps",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The user is in the 'Apps' section where they can manage apps for Do Not Disturb mode, and the 'Add apps' element is the next step to customize notifications as required by the task."
}
```
