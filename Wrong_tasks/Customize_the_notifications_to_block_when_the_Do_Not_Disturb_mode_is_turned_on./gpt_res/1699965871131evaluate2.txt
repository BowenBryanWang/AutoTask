system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: The history of operations shows that the user has scrolled forward on an android.widget.ScrollView.

Step 2: We have the current UI screen with several clickable div elements, each representing different settings options like Storage, Privacy, Location, Security, Accounts, Accessibility, Digital Wellbeing & parental controls, Google, and System. The task is to delete a guest user named Alice from the device. Typically, user management options, including guest user options, are found within the 'Accounts' or 'Users' settings on Android devices.

Step 3: Based on our understanding of the typical Android settings menu and the hint provided, the 'Accounts' section is the most likely place to find options related to user management. Therefore, we should select the div element that corresponds to the 'Accounts' section to proceed with the task.

Step 4: We will now score the UI elements. Since 'Accounts' is the most relevant to our task, it will receive the highest score. The <scroll /> element will also receive a relatively high score in case we need to explore further options that are not currently visible on the screen. Other elements are less relevant to the task at hand, so they will receive lower scores.

Here are the scores:

- 'Storage', 'Privacy', 'Location', 'Security', 'Accessibility', 'Digital Wellbeing & parental controls', 'Google', and 'System' are not directly related to user management and thus receive lower scores.
- 'Accounts' is directly related to user management, so it receives the highest score.
- <scroll /> is given a high score as well because there might be additional relevant options not yet visible.
