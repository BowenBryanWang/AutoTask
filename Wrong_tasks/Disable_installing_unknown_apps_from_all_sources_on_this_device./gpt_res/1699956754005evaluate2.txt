system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", the user previously clicked on the battery settings and scrolled forward, but there was no response, indicating that the scroll operation was incorrect.

Step 2: Looking at the "Successive results", after scrolling, the UI elements listed are still the same as those on the current screen. This suggests that scrolling did not reveal any new information or it wasn't registered properly.

Step 3: Based on the "Hint" provided by another model, it suggests continuing to interact with the scroll element (id=2), as the current UI contains relevant information to the user's task. This aligns with the user's task to check battery life and usage on the phone, as the scrollable area likely contains additional details about battery usage that the user has not seen yet due to the previous unsuccessful scroll action.

Step 4: Synthesizing the information from the previous steps, the scores for the UI elements on the current page are as follows:

- "id=1", which represents "More options", might provide access to additional settings or information, but it's not directly related to checking the battery life and usage. It could be useful if the user needs more details after reviewing the main battery information. I would rate it as 4.00, indicating minor relevance.
- "id=2", the scrollable RecyclerView, is the element suggested to interact with next according to the hint and the task at hand. It should be scored highest as it likely contains the information the user is seeking. I would rate it as 10.00, indicating it is the most likely to be chosen and executed.
- "id=3" to "id=6" represent various settings and statuses related to battery life, but they are static information already visible to the user. They do not need to be interacted with to complete the task of checking the battery life and usage. Therefore, I would rate them lower than the scroll action but still provide a score that reflects their relevance to the task. I would rate them as 6.00, indicating they are related but not the next step.

Based on the analysis, the JSON object with scores would be:

```json
{
    "id_1": 4.00,
    "id_2": 10.00,
    "id_3": 6.00,
    "id_4": 6.00,
    "id_5": 6.00,
    "id_6": 6.00
}
