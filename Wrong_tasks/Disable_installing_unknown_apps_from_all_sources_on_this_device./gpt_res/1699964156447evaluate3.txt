system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: The history of operations shows that the user has been navigating through the "Apps & notifications" settings and has already attempted to scroll forward twice on a RecyclerView, which did not yield the desired result and led to a navigation back due to an error.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows various options related to apps and notifications settings, such as "Conversations," "Notifications," "Screen time," "Default apps," and "Permission manager." None of these options directly relate to disabling the installation of unknown apps. The "Successive results" indicate that scrolling forward on the RecyclerView will reveal more options, including "Wireless emergency alerts" and "Special app access."

Step 3: Based on the task at hand, the user needs to find the option to disable installing unknown apps from all sources. The "Special app access" option seems like the most relevant path to follow, as it could potentially lead to the setting that controls the installation of apps from unknown sources.

Step 4: Given that none of the currently visible elements directly relate to the task, and following the hint provided, the best course of action is to scroll forward on the RecyclerView to explore more options. The "Special app access" option should appear after additional scrolling, based on the "Successive results." Therefore, the <scroll id=1> should receive the highest score, as it is the most likely to lead to the desired setting.

Here is the JSON object with the scores:

{
    "id_1": 7.50,
    "id_2": 1.00,
    "id_3": 1.00,
    "id_4": 1.00,
    "id_5": 1.00,
    "id_6": 1.00,
    "id_7": 1.00,
    "id_8": 1.00,
    "id_9": 1.00,
    "id_10": 1.00
