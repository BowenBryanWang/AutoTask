system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"scroll id=2 class=androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The current UI page contains a scrollable element that may lead to the detailed battery usage information necessary to complete the task.\"}",

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it is evident that several attempts to access the "Battery Manager" and other elements were made, but these actions did not yield the desired result, as indicated by the "Navigate back due to error" entries. It is also noted that scrolling was attempted multiple times but was followed by an error message indicating an incorrect operation.

Step 2: Analyzing the "Successive results," it is clear that clicking on elements with ids 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 does not lead to the Battery Usage page, as these actions have been attempted previously without success. The "Successive results" for scrolling (id=2) show a list of items related to battery information, but it does not explicitly indicate access to the Battery Usage page.

Step 3: Considering the given hint, the scrollable element (id=2) is suggested as the next UI element to interact with. This aligns with the task of checking the Battery Usage page, as detailed battery usage information is typically found by scrolling through the battery settings.

Step 4: Synthesizing the information above, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:

- id=1 (More options): This element has not been interacted with according to the history, but it is unlikely to lead directly to the Battery Usage page. It may provide additional settings or options related to battery but not the specific page we are looking for. Score: 3.50
- id=2 (scroll): This is the most likely candidate based on the hint and the fact that detailed information is often found by scrolling through settings. Score: 9.00
- id=3 (Apps are running normally): This has been clicked on before and did not lead to the Battery Usage page. Score: 2.00
- id=4 (Battery Saver): This option has been clicked on before and did not lead to the Battery Usage page. Score: 2.00
- id=5 (Battery Manager): This has been clicked on multiple times without success, indicating it is not the correct path. Score: 1.00
- id=6 (Battery percentage): This has been clicked on before and did not lead to the Battery Usage page. Score: 2.00
- id=7 (switch for Battery percentage): This is a toggle and not related to navigating to the Battery Usage page. Score: 1.00

Final JSON object with scores:
