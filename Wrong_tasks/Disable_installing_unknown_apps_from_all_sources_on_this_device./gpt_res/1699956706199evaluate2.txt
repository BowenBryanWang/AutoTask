system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    }
}

===response===
Step 1: The user has already clicked on the battery settings where the summary indicated a 100% battery charge. There is no indication of a wrong step that caused a navigate back.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows various elements related to battery information, including a percentage, status (Full), apps running normally, battery saver, battery manager, battery percentage option, last full charge, screen usage since the last charge, and a note that battery usage data is approximate. The hint suggests that scrolling could reveal more information relevant to the task of checking the battery life and usage.

Step 3: Since the task is to check the battery life and usage, and the current screen already shows the battery percentage and some usage details, the next logical step is to explore further by scrolling. The scrollable area indicated by <scroll id=2> is likely to contain additional details on battery usage that could help complete the user's task.

Step 4: Based on the relevance to the task, the ratings for the UI elements are as follows:

- "id_1": 1.00 (More options button, not directly relevant to checking battery life and usage)
- "id_2": 9.50 (Scrollable area, highly relevant as it likely contains more detailed battery usage information)
- "id_3": 2.00 (Button with a message about app performance, less relevant to battery life and specific usage details)
- "id_4": 1.00 (Battery Saver, not directly relevant to checking current battery usage)
- "id_5": 1.00 (Battery Manager, not directly relevant to checking current battery usage)
- "id_6": 1.00 (Battery percentage in status bar setting, not directly relevant to checking current battery usage)
- "id_7": 1.00 (Switch for showing battery percentage, not directly relevant to checking current battery usage)

The scrollable area (id_2) has the highest score as it is the most promising element to explore further information relevant to the task.

Outputting the JSON object with scores:

{
    "id_1": 1.00, 
    "id_2": 9.50, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00
