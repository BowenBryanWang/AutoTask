system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: Review the "History operation sequence". The user has previously clicked on items related to the battery and scrolled through the RecyclerView, but those actions were marked as unresponsive and therefore incorrect. The user needs to check battery life and usage, which suggests looking for detailed battery usage statistics or graphs.

Step 2: Examine the "Successive results" of each UI element. The elements id=3, id=4, id=5, id=6, and id=7 do not seem to lead to more detailed battery usage information based on their descriptions. However, scrolling (id=2) might reveal more options or detailed statistics, as indicated by the hint from another model.

Step 3: Decide the next step. Since the user needs to check battery life and usage and the previous clicks on specific items were not responsive, the best course of action seems to be to explore the UI further by scrolling.

Step 4: Synthesize the output. Based on the task and the hint provided, scrolling (id=2) is the most relevant action to take next, as it may reveal more detailed information about battery life and usage. The other clickable items have already been tried or do not directly relate to the task at hand.

Outputting the scores in JSON format:

{
    "id_1": 1.00, 
    "id_2": 9.50, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00
}

The scroll action (id_2) is given a high score because it is likely to reveal more information. The other elements are given a low score because they were either previously unresponsive or do not seem to directly relate to the task.
