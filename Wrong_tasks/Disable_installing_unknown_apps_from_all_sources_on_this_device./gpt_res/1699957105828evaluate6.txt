system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Review the "History operation sequence".
- The user has attempted to find battery usage information by clicking on various elements such as "Battery", "Battery Manager", and "Battery usage", but these actions did not yield the desired result, leading to a navigation back due to an error.
- The user has also scrolled forward multiple times, which did not yield a response, indicating those were incorrect actions.

Step 2: Analyze the "Successive Results" of each UI option.
- All UI elements, when clicked, seem to provide similar information related to the battery but do not lead directly to the detailed battery usage information.
- The hint suggests that scrolling the "androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView" may reveal more information.

Step 3: Decide the next action.
- Since the user has previously clicked on elements without success and the hint suggests that scrolling may reveal more information, the best course of action is to continue scrolling.

Step 4: Output a JSON object with scores.
- "id_1" (More options): This has been clicked before and did not lead to the battery usage details. However, it might still be relevant if we have not explored all its options. I rate it medium as it could potentially lead to a hidden menu or additional settings: 5.00.
- "id_2" (<scroll>): The hint suggests that further information could be revealed by scrolling, and since we're looking for more detailed battery usage information, this seems to be the most likely candidate: 9.00.
- "id_3" to "id_6" (Various battery-related settings): These have been clicked before and did not provide the required information. They might still be relevant but less likely than scrolling: 4.00 each.
- "id_7" (Battery percentage switch): This is a toggle for showing battery percentage and is not directly related to checking the battery life or usage: 2.00.

Here is the synthesized JSON object:

{
    "id_1": 5.00,
    "id_2": 9.00,
    "id_3": 4.00,
    "id_4": 4.00,
    "id_5": 4.00,
    "id_6": 4.00,
    "id_7": 2.00
