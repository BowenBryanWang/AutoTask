system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", I can see that clicks on "Battery" and "Battery Manager" did not yield the desired response and resulted in errors, leading to a navigation back. Multiple scrolls on the RecyclerView also did not seem to help.

Step 2: Looking at the "Successive results" for each UI element, it's clear that each of the clickable elements (id=3, id=4, id=5, id=6) leads to similar results, which do not directly suggest that they will take the user to the Battery Usage page. Therefore, these elements seem to have a lower relevance to the task.

Step 3: The hint from another model suggests that scrolling (id=2) on the RecyclerView may reveal more information off-screen, potentially including the detailed Battery Usage statistics that the user is looking for. Given the previous unsuccessful attempts with other clickable elements and the suggestion that scrolling may reveal more information, scrolling seems to be the most relevant action to take next.

Step 4: Based on the above analysis, here are the scores for the UI elements:

- Clickable elements (id=3, id=4, id=5, id=6) have been tried and led to errors, indicating they are less likely to be the correct path to the Battery Usage page. I would rate them in the lower tier due to their history of errors and lack of direct relevance to the task.
- Scrolling (id=2) has not been thoroughly explored according to the successive results and the hint suggests it could reveal more information. Therefore, it should have a higher rating.

Here is the synthesized output:

{
    "id_1": 1.00, 
    "id_2": 7.50, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 2.00, 
    "id_5": 2.00, 
    "id_6": 2.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00
