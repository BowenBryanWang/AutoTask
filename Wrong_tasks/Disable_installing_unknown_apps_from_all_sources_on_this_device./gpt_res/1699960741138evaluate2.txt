system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: The history shows that the user has clicked on a title element related to the Battery, which brought them to the current Battery page displaying various battery-related information.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows several elements related to battery information, including a 'More options' button (id_1), battery percentage (not clickable), status messages (not clickable), and clickable items such as 'Battery Saver' (id_4), 'Battery Manager' (id_5), and 'Battery percentage' (id_6). There is also a scrollable element (id_2) which may contain more information below the fold. The hint suggests that scrolling may reveal additional details that are not currently visible on the screen.

Step 3: Since the task is to check the Battery Usage page, and the user is already on this page, the next logical step would be to explore more information that is not currently visible on the screen. Following the hint provided by another model, scrolling would be the most appropriate action to discover more details about battery usage.

Step 4: Based on the relevance to the task of checking the Battery Usage page, the following ratings are assigned:

- 'More options' (id_1) is likely a settings or additional options button, which may not directly relate to viewing more battery usage details but could be useful for other settings (Rating: 4.00 for potential relevance).
- Scrolling (id_2) is the most relevant action as it may reveal more battery usage details that are not visible on the current screen (Rating: 10.00 for highest relevance).
- 'Battery Saver' (id_4), 'Battery Manager' (id_5), and 'Battery percentage' (id_6) are related to battery settings but not directly to checking the battery usage details (Rating: 6.00 for relevance to battery settings, but not specifically to the task of checking battery usage).

    "id_1": 4.00, "id_2": 10.00, "id_4": 6.00, "id_5": 6.00, "id_6": 6.00
