system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: The history of operations indicates that the user clicked on a battery-related element, scrolled forward but did not get a response (which was a mistake), and then clicked on 'More options'. The lack of response to the scroll might suggest that the desired information was not found in the list, or the user was unsure where to find the information. 

Step 2: The current UI screen only has one element, which is a clickable titled 'Battery usage'. There are no successive results provided, which means we do not have information about what happens after clicking on this element. However, the hint suggests that clicking on 'Battery usage' is the correct next step. The possible paths to the UI target also indicate that the clickable 'android:id/title' Battery usage is the path to follow.

Step 3: Given the task to view battery usage details and the information provided, the next logical step would be to click on the 'Battery usage' element. Since this is the only interactive element currently available on the screen and directly relates to the task at hand, it should be the next element to be operated.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output, the clickable 'Battery usage' is the most relevant to the task. As there are no other elements to compare it to, it should be rated the highest. Since it is directly related to the task, it should receive a score indicating the highest likelihood of being the correct choice.
