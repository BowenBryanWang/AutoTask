system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", the user initially clicked on a title related to the battery, scrolled forward twice which resulted in errors, clicked on "Battery Manager" twice, and then navigated back due to an error.

Step 2: Looking at the "Successive Results" for each UI element, they all seem to provide similar subsequent items. None of the elements directly mention "Battery Usage details," but since the user previously interacted with "Battery Manager," it might be a relevant area to explore further. The hint also suggests continuing with the "Battery Manager" element.

Step 3: Deciding the next step, based on the hint and the history, it seems like clicking on the "Battery Manager" might be the correct action since it is related to battery management. However, since this action previously led to an error, we should be cautious. The "possible paths to UI target" suggest that the "Battery Manager" could be a path to explore for battery usage data, although it does not specify any further details.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above, the element "Battery Manager" (id_5) seems to be the most relevant to the task at hand. The "More options" (id_1) might offer additional actions but is less directly related to the task. The <scroll/> element (id_2) could reveal more options, but since scrolling previously resulted in errors, it should be rated lower. The other clickable elements (id_4 and id_6) do not seem to directly relate to checking battery usage details.

Here are the ratings based on the analysis:

- "Battery Manager" (id_5) is related to battery settings and was suggested by the hint.
- "More options" (id_1) could potentially contain more settings related to battery usage.
- <scroll/> (id_2) should be rated but with caution due to previous errors.
- "Battery Saver" (id_4) and "Battery percentage" (id_6) are less related to the task.

JSON output with scores:

```json
{
    "id_1": 5.00,
    "id_2": 4.00,
    "id_4": 2.00,
    "id_5": 8.50,
    "id_6": 2.00
}
```

Given the context and the hint, "Battery Manager" (id_5) appears to be the best candidate for the next action with a rating of 8.50. The "More options" (id_1) is rated 5.00 as it could be useful but is not as directly related to the task. The <scroll/> (id_2) is given a 4.00 due to the potential for more information but with caution. The other clickable elements related to "Battery Saver" (id_4) and "Battery percentage" (id_6) are given a lower score of 2.00 since they are not directly related to checking battery usage details.
