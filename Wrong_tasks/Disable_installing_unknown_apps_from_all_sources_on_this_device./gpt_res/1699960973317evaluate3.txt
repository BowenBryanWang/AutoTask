system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: The history shows multiple attempts to click on items that didn't yield the expected results, and a scroll action that was followed by a navigate back due to error. It's important to note that clicking on "Battery Manager" was a wrong action that led to navigation back.

Step 2: The "Successive Results" indicate that the elements with ids 3, 4, 5, and 6 do not lead to a different screen or provide more detailed battery usage information. Instead, they show summaries or settings that are related to battery features but not the battery usage details themselves.

Step 3: Based on the hint provided, the user should continue to scroll to explore further details on battery usage. The <scroll id=2> element seems to be the correct path to follow as it is likely to contain more information related to the battery usage page.

Step 4: Given the task and the hint, the <scroll id=2> element is the most relevant and should receive the highest score. The clickable elements (id_3, id_4, id_5, id_6) are less relevant as they have been tried before and led to errors or did not provide the expected results. The "More options" (id_1) might provide access to additional settings or information, but scrolling is suggested as the next action.

Here is the JSON object with the scores:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 9.50, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00
}
