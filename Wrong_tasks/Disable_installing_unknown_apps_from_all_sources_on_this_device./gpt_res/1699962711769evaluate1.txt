system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it appears that the user previously clicked on an item related to "Privacy" but had to navigate back due to an error. This suggests that the "Privacy" item led to a wrong path or was not the correct item for the task at hand.

Step 2: Analyzing the "Successive results," none of the items directly mention settings related to installing apps from unknown sources, which is typically found under a security or applications setting. 

However, the option "Apps & notifications" seems to be the most relevant, as it is commonly associated with app settings, including permissions and sources for app installations. While the "Successive results" for "id=4" do not explicitly mention installation from unknown sources, it is the most semantically related to the task.

Step 3: Based on the information provided and typical Android settings structure, the next step should be to click on the "Apps & notifications" item to explore further options that may lead to the setting for disabling installations from unknown sources.

Step 4: Scoring the UI elements based on their relevance to the task:

- "Network & internet" (id=2) does not directly relate to app installation settings. Score: 2.00
- "Connected devices" (id=3) is not related to app installation settings. Score: 2.00
- "Apps & notifications" (id=4) is the most likely candidate for containing the relevant setting. Score: 9.00
- "Battery" (id=5) is not related to app installation settings. Score: 2.00
- "Display" (id=6) is not related to app installation settings. Score: 2.00
- "Sound" (id=7) is not related to app installation settings. Score: 2.00
- "Storage" (id=8) is not related to app installation settings. Score: 2.00
- "Privacy" (id=9) was previously selected and led to an error, so it is unlikely to be the correct path. Score: 1.50

Given that the user may need to scroll if the relevant setting is not immediately visible, the <scroll> element should receive a score higher than those of unrelated items but lower than the score for "Apps & notifications."

Outputting the scores in JSON format:

{
    "id_1": 3.00,
    "id_2": 2.00,
    "id_3": 2.00,
    "id_4": 9.00,
    "id_5": 2.00,
    "id_6": 2.00,
    "id_7": 2.00,
    "id_8": 2.00,
    "id_9": 1.50
