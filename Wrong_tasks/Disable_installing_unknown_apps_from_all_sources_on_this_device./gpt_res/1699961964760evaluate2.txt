system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: The user has clicked on the "Battery" option in a previous step, which likely brought them to the current screen that displays various battery-related settings and information.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows several elements related to battery settings, such as "Battery Saver," "Battery Manager," and "Battery percentage." However, there are no explicit elements indicating "Battery Usage details," which is the user's goal. The hint suggests that scrolling may reveal more details, and the possible paths suggest that items like "Battery Manager" and "Battery Saver" are clickable and may lead to more information.

Step 3: Based on the information given, the user should continue to explore the battery settings to find detailed usage information. Since the "Successive results" are not provided, we must rely on the current UI and the hint to guide the next action. The hint suggests scrolling, and the possible paths indicate that "Battery Manager" might be a relevant section to explore further.

Step 4: Scoring the UI elements accordingly, considering their relevance to the task:

- "More options" (id_1): This could lead to additional settings or information but is less direct than other options. Score: 4.50
- Scrolling (id_2): The hint suggests that scrolling may reveal more details, which is necessary to complete the task. Score: 9.00
- "Apps are running normally" button (id_3): This is likely a status message and not directly related to the detailed battery usage. Score: 2.00
- "Battery Saver" (id_4): It's a setting that could affect battery usage, but it's not directly related to viewing battery usage details. Score: 6.00
- "Battery Manager" (id_5): This is a promising candidate as it is related to managing battery usage and could contain the details the user is looking for. Score: 8.50
- "Battery percentage" (id_6): This toggle is related to the display settings of the battery percentage, not to the usage details. Score: 2.00
- "Battery percentage" switch (id_7): This is a control element for the setting mentioned in id_6, so it also has a low relevance. Score: 2.00

Based on the above analysis, the user should try scrolling first to look for more details. If that does not yield the desired information, "Battery Manager" would be the next best option to explore.
