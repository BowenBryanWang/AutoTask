system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no history of operations, so we have a fresh start and no need to correct any previous mistakes.

Step 2: Looking at the current UI screen, we have several clickable div elements within a scrollable view. Since the task is to check the Battery Usage page, we should focus on the div that is most likely related to battery information.

Step 3: The div with id_5 has a title "Battery" and a summary indicating the current battery level ("100%"). This is the most relevant option for the given task, as it directly pertains to battery information. It is reasonable to assume that clicking this element would take us to the Battery Usage page or provide more detailed battery-related information.

The other div elements pertain to different settings and are not directly related to the task at hand. However, if the Battery Usage page is not directly accessible from the div with id_5, we may need to scroll to find more options.

Step 4: Based on the analysis above, here are the scores for each UI element:

- id_2 (Network & internet): 2.00 (low relevance)
- id_3 (Connected devices): 2.00 (low relevance)
- id_4 (Apps & notifications): 2.00 (low relevance)
- id_5 (Battery): 10.00 (highest relevance, most likely to be chosen)
- id_6 (Display): 2.00 (low relevance)
- id_7 (Sound): 2.00 (low relevance)
- id_8 (Storage): 2.00 (low relevance)
- id_9 (Privacy): 2.00 (low relevance)
- id_1 (scroll): 3.00 (in case more options are needed, this is the next most relevant operation)

Here is the JSON object with the scores:

{
    "id_1": 3.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 2.00, 
    "id_5": 10.00, 
    "id_6": 2.00, 
    "id_7": 2.00, 
    "id_8": 2.00, 
    "id_9": 2.00
