system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it seems that the user has attempted to scroll the RecyclerView twice, but these actions did not yield the desired response, indicating they were incorrect. The last successful action was clicking on the "Battery Manager" option.

Step 2: The "Successive results" show the results of interacting with each UI element. None of the results explicitly mention accessing detailed battery usage, but the "Battery Manager" has been interacted with before, and it seems to be related to detecting apps that drain the battery. The hint also suggests that "Battery Manager" or scrolling the RecyclerView could lead to the completion of the task.

Step 3: Based on the "possible paths to UI target," it seems that the "Battery Manager" option is related to battery usage details. Given that the last successful action was clicking on "Battery Manager," and the hint provided by another model suggests that "Battery Manager" or scrolling could reveal more information, these two options seem the most relevant.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:

- "id_1" (More options): It does not seem directly related to battery usage details. Score: 2.00
- "id_2" (RecyclerView scroll): The user has already attempted to scroll twice without success, but scrolling might still reveal more options. Score: 7.50
- "id_3" (Apps are running normally button): This is less likely to lead to detailed battery usage. Score: 2.00
- "id_4" (Battery Saver): This is related to a setting rather than usage details. Score: 2.00
- "id_5" (Battery Manager): This has been clicked before and is related to detecting battery drain, which could lead to usage details. Score: 8.50
- "id_6" (Battery percentage): This is a setting and not directly related to usage details. Score: 2.00

Given the hint and the history, "Battery Manager" (id_5) seems like the most likely candidate for providing battery usage details, followed by scrolling the RecyclerView (id_2) to reveal more options.

The JSON object with scores is:

{
    "id_1": 2.00,
    "id_2": 7.50,
    "id_3": 2.00,
    "id_4": 2.00,
    "id_5": 8.50,
    "id_6": 2.00
