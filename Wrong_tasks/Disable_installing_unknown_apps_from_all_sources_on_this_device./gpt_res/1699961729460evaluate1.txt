system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no history of operations provided, so we begin with a fresh state with no prior steps to consider.

Step 2: The task is to check the battery usage details of the phone. On the current UI screen, we have several options, but one stands out as directly relevant to the task:

- id_5 corresponds to the "Battery" option, which typically would lead to more detailed battery usage information.

The other options present on the screen such as Network & internet, Connected devices, Apps & notifications, Display, Sound, Storage, and Privacy are not directly related to the task of checking battery usage details.

Step 3: To proceed, we should select the UI element that is most likely to lead us to the battery usage details. In this case, it's the "Battery" option with id_5.

Step 4: Here are the scores for the UI elements based on their relevance to the task:

- id_2: Network & internet settings are not directly related to battery usage details. Score: 2.00
- id_3: Connected devices settings are also not directly related to battery usage details. Score: 2.00
- id_4: Apps & notifications might indirectly affect battery usage, but this is not where we would find battery usage details. Score: 3.00
- id_5: Directly related to the task, as this is where battery information is typically found. Score: 10.00
- id_6: Display settings can affect battery life but are not where usage details are found. Score: 2.00
- id_7: Sound settings are unrelated to battery usage details. Score: 2.00
- id_8: Storage information is unrelated to battery usage details. Score: 2.00
- id_9: Privacy settings are unrelated to battery usage details. Score: 2.00
- <scroll id=1>: While scrolling may reveal more options, we already see the relevant option on the screen. However, if the user needs to scroll to actually click on the "Battery" option, it should have a high score as well. Score: 8.00 (assuming the "Battery" option is not immediately clickable without scrolling)

In JSON format:
