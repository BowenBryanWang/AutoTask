system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no history of operations, which means this is the starting point for the task of disabling installing unknown apps from all sources on the device.

Step 2: The task requires navigating to settings that control the installation of apps from unknown sources. Among the available UI elements, "Apps & notifications" is the most relevant category as it typically includes settings for app permissions and accesses. The "Privacy" section could also contain relevant settings, as it deals with permissions and personal data, which may include the control of app installation sources. The other categories like "Network & internet," "Connected devices," "Battery," "Display," "Sound," and "Storage" are not directly related to the installation of apps from unknown sources.

Step 3: The next step should be to navigate to the most likely place where the setting to disable installing unknown apps can be found. The "Apps & notifications" section is the most probable location for this setting. If the setting is not found there, the next place to check would be the "Privacy" section.

Based on the relevance to the task, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:

- "Apps & notifications" (id_4) is the most likely place to contain the setting, so it gets the highest score.
- "Privacy" (id_9) is the next most relevant section and should be considered if "Apps & notifications" does not yield the desired setting.
- The <scroll> element (id_1) should have a score higher than the unrelated categories but lower than "Apps & notifications" and "Privacy" as it may be necessary to scroll to find additional settings.
- The other categories are not related to the task and should receive the lowest scores.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output, the JSON object with scores is:

{
    "id_1": 7.00,
    "id_2": 1.00,
    "id_3": 1.00,
    "id_4": 9.50,
    "id_5": 1.00,
    "id_6": 1.00,
    "id_7": 1.00,
    "id_8": 1.00,
    "id_9": 8.50
