system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

NOTE in this History Pages and Action Dict format:
1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

([] means it's empty in the latest page and cannot go on)


===response===
Step 1:
The history of actions indicates that the user is trying to view the battery usage details of their phone. The first action was to click on the 'Battery' option from the settings menu, which is correct as it leads to the battery settings page. The user then scrolled forward, which did not lead to the desired outcome, as indicated by the note "上步操作没有响应，因此是错误的" (the previous operation did not respond, therefore it is wrong). The user then clicked on 'More options' which did not result in an error, followed by clicking on 'Battery usage'. The last action, clicking on 'Battery usage', is on the correct track as it is an attempt to view more detailed information about battery usage, which is the goal of the user's task.

Step 2:
The latest UI page shows elements related to battery usage, such as the charge percentage and a label indicating "BATTERY USAGE SINCE FULL CHARGE". However, it also states "Battery usage data isn’t available." This suggests that the current UI does not provide the detailed battery usage information that the user is seeking. Therefore, the current UI page, in its present state, cannot lead to the UI task fulfillment of viewing battery usage details.

Step 3:
There are no elements with general purposes that are worth exploring on the current UI page. The only interactive element present is the 'More options' button, but since it has already been clicked as per the action history, it is unlikely to provide additional information on battery usage details. Furthermore, there are no <scroll /> elements present, indicating that there is no additional content available off-screen that could be accessed by scrolling.

Step 4:
Synthesizing the above thoughts, the conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

```json
{
    "next ui element": null,
    "status": "wrong",
    "reason": "The last UI page does not provide the necessary battery usage details, and there are no additional elements or actions on the current page that can lead to the completion of the user's task. The 'Battery usage data isn’t available' message suggests that the necessary data cannot be accessed from this page, and a different approach or navigation to a previous state may be required to fulfill the task."
