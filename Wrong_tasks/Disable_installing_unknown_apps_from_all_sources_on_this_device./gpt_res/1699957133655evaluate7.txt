system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", there have been multiple attempts to access battery-related information. The user has tried clicking on various elements related to the battery, such as "Battery" and "Battery Manager", and has scrolled through the RecyclerView. However, these actions did not yield the desired result, and there were errors that led to navigating back. The last action before reaching the current UI screen was clicking on "More options", which doesn't seem to have resulted in an error.

Step 2: The "Successive Results" for the current option "id=1" show a list of elements that are related to battery usage information, such as charge percentage, usage since the last full charge, and labels indicating time and charge levels. This suggests that clicking on "id=1" would indeed provide details on battery usage, which aligns with the user's task.

Step 3: The "Hint" provided suggests that the element "clickable 'android:id/title' Battery usage" should be clicked to proceed, and this action is expected to lead to the battery usage details. This confirms that the next step should be to click on the element that represents "Battery usage".

Step 4: Given the information above, the rating for the clickable element "Battery usage" should be high as it is directly related to the user's task. The "possible paths to UI target" also indicate that clicking on the "Battery usage" element is the correct path. Therefore, we assign a high rating to "id=1" since it matches the user's goal of checking the battery life and usage on the phone.

The JSON object with the score is as follows:

{
    "id_1": 9.50
}
