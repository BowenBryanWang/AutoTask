system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Successive results": {},
    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"Advanced\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The 'Advanced' section within the 'Apps & notifications' settings may lead to more specialized settings where the option to disable installing unknown apps could potentially be found.

}

===response===
Step 1: The history shows that the user has clicked on "Apps & notifications" but has not yet completed the task of disabling installing unknown apps from all sources. There are no wrong steps indicated in the history.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows various options, but none of them directly mention installing unknown apps. However, the "Advanced" option suggests that it may lead to more specialized settings, which could include the option to disable installing unknown apps.

Step 3: Based on the hint provided by another model, the "Advanced" section is likely the correct path to follow to find the option to disable installing unknown apps. Since none of the other options on the screen seem directly related to the task, the "Advanced" section should be the next to be operated.

Step 4: Assigning scores to the UI elements:
- id_1 to id_6 are not directly related to the task and seem to lead to information about recently used apps, conversations, notifications, and screen time, so they get a lower score.
- id_7, labeled "Advanced," is likely to lead to more specialized settings, which could include security settings for installing apps from unknown sources.

Here are the scores for the UI elements:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, "id_2": 2.00, "id_3": 2.00, "id_4": 2.00, "id_5": 2.00, "id_6": 2.00, "id_7": 9.00
