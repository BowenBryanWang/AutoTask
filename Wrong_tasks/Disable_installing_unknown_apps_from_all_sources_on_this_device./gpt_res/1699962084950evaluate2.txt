system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: Reviewing the history of operations, it appears that scrolling forward on the RecyclerView did not yield the desired result and was considered an incorrect action twice.

Step 2: Looking at the current UI screen and the successive results, we need to find an element that likely leads to the detailed battery usage information. The hint provided by another model suggests that we should continue interacting with the RecyclerView to explore more content.

Step 3: Based on the hint and the possible paths to the UI target, we should focus on elements that would likely show more detailed battery usage. The elements that stand out are the clickable items that may lead to more detailed screens, such as "Battery Manager", "Battery Saver", and "Battery percentage". However, the history suggests that scrolling did not work previously, which could mean that the needed information is not further down the list but rather within one of the clickable items.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above, here are the scores for the elements:

- "id_1" (More options): This might lead to additional settings or information, but it's not clear if it would show battery usage details. Score: 6.00
- "id_2" (RecyclerView scroll): Despite the previous failed attempts, the hint suggests there might be more content. However, caution is advised due to past failures. Score: 5.00
- "id_3" (Apps running normally button): This seems to be a status message rather than a detailed usage screen. Score: 3.00
- "id_4" (Battery Saver): This is likely a setting to conserve battery, not to check its usage details. Score: 4.00
- "id_5" (Battery Manager): This sounds promising as it may lead to more detailed battery usage information. Score: 8.00
- "id_6" (Battery percentage): This is a setting to show battery percentage, not detailed usage. Score: 3.00
- "id_7" (Switch for battery percentage): This is part of the battery percentage setting and not related to usage details. Score: 2.00

Considering the hint and the possible paths, the clickable "Battery Manager" seems to be the most relevant option for checking battery usage details. Therefore, "id_5" should be the next UI element to interact with.
