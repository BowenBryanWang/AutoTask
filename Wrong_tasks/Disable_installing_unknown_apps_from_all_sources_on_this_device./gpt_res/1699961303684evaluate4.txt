system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"scroll\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The current UI contains elements related to the battery, and the presence of a scrollable RecyclerView suggests there may be more information available by scrolling, which could lead to the fulfillment of the user's task to check the Battery Usage page.\"}",

===response===
Step 1: The history of operations shows several attempts to access different battery-related settings, such as "Battery Manager" and "Battery percentage," but these attempts have resulted in errors and navigation back. The user is trying to check the Battery Usage page, but there is no clear indication that they have successfully accessed it yet.

Step 2: The "Successive results" indicate the outcomes of clicking on various elements on the current UI screen. None of these results specifically mention accessing the Battery Usage page. However, the hint provided suggests that scrolling could reveal more information related to the battery, which could potentially include the Battery Usage page.

Step 3: Given the task is to check the Battery Usage page and considering the hint provided, the most likely next step is to scroll within the RecyclerView to reveal more options or information that could lead to the Battery Usage page. Previous clicks on elements such as "Battery Manager" and "Battery percentage" have not led to the desired page, so these should be rated lower.

Step 4: Based on the analysis, the ratings for the UI elements on the current screen are as follows:

- "id=1" represents "More options," which might not directly lead to the Battery Usage page, but could contain relevant settings. However, since there is no mention of it leading to the Battery Usage page, it should be rated with medium relevance: 5.00.
- "id=2" is the scrollable RecyclerView, which, based on the hint and the fact that there may be more information available by scrolling, should be rated the highest: 9.00.
- "id=3" is a button related to app behavior and battery usage, but it does not specifically refer to the Battery Usage page: 4.00.
- "id=4" refers to "Battery Saver," which is related to battery settings but not to the Battery Usage page: 4.00.
- "id=5" refers to "Battery Manager," which has been clicked previously without success and does not directly lead to the Battery Usage page: 3.00.
- "id=6" refers to "Battery percentage," which is a setting that has been clicked before and does not lead to the Battery Usage page: 3.00.
- "id=7" is the switch for showing battery percentage in the status bar, which is unrelated to accessing the Battery Usage page: 3.00.

The final JSON object with scores is:

{
    "id_1": 5.00,
    "id_2": 9.00,
    "id_3": 4.00,
    "id_4": 4.00,
    "id_5": 3.00,
    "id_6": 3.00,
    "id_7": 3.00
