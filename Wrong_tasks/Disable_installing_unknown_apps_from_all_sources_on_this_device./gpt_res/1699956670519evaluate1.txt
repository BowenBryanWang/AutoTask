system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: The history operation sequence is empty, which means no actions have been taken yet.

Step 2: To check the battery life and usage on the phone, the user needs to navigate to the section of the settings that deals with the battery. In the current UI screen, there is a div with id_5 that is titled "Battery" and shows a summary indicating "100%". This suggests that it is the section where the user can find information about the battery life and possibly more detailed usage.

Step 3: Since the task is to check the battery life and usage, the most relevant UI element to operate next would be the "Battery" section. The user should click on this section to view more details about the battery status and usage.

Here are the ratings for the UI elements based on their relevance to the task:

- id_2 (Network & internet): This is not related to battery life and usage. Rating: 1.00
- id_3 (Connected devices): Also not related to battery life and usage. Rating: 1.00
- id_4 (Apps & notifications): This could be somewhat related to battery usage because apps can affect battery life, but it's not the direct battery settings. Rating: 2.50
- id_5 (Battery): This is directly related to the task at hand. Rating: 10.00
- id_6 (Display): Display settings can affect battery life, but it's not the battery usage section. Rating: 2.00
- id_7 (Sound): Sound settings are unrelated to battery life and usage. Rating: 1.00
- id_8 (Storage): Storage is unrelated to battery life and usage. Rating: 1.00
- id_9 (Privacy): Privacy settings are unrelated to battery life and usage. Rating: 1.00
- <scroll id=1>: Scrolling might reveal more options, but since we already found the battery section, it's not necessary at this moment. Rating: 1.50

Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

{
    "id_1": 1.50, "id_2": 1.00, "id_3": 1.00, "id_4": 2.50, "id_5": 10.00, "id_6": 2.00, "id_7": 1.00, "id_8": 1.00, "id_9": 1.00
