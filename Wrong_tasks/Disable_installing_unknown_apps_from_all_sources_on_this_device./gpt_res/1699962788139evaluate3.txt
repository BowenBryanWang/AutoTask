system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

}

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," it appears that the user initially clicked on a Privacy setting but navigated back due to an error. Subsequently, the user accessed "Apps & notifications" and then clicked on "Advanced," which suggests the user is looking for a more detailed settings area within the Apps & notifications section.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen," there are several clickable items including recently opened apps, conversations, notifications, screen time, default apps, and permission manager. However, none of these elements directly relate to the task of disabling the option to install apps from unknown sources.

Considering the "Hint" provided, it suggests using the "<scroll />" element to explore further options that may not be immediately visible on the current screen. Since the task relates to security and permissions, it is likely that the option to disable installations from unknown sources would be found in a more advanced or security-focused section of the settings, which might be accessible by scrolling down.

Step 3: Since none of the visible items on the screen directly pertain to the task and the hint suggests scrolling, the next logical action is to scroll to uncover more settings that could include the option to disable app installations from unknown sources.

Step 4: Based on the analysis:

- "id_2" to "id_10" are clickable items but none of them seem directly relevant to the task. They should be rated lower since they do not appear to lead to the setting to disable app installations from unknown sources.
- "<scroll id=1>" is the most relevant action to take as it aligns with the hint and the logic that additional settings may be found by scrolling.

Here is the JSON object with the scores:

{
    "id_1": 9.00, 
    "id_2": 1.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00, 
    "id_8": 1.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00, 
    "id_10": 1.00
}

The scroll action has been given a high score because it is the most likely action to help the user find the setting they are looking for, according to the hint and the logical analysis of the user's task and the history of operations.
