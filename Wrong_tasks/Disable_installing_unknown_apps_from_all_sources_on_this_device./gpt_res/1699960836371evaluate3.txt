system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", it is noted that a previous attempt to scroll on "androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView" did not yield a response, indicating that the action was incorrect. However, a click on the "Battery Manager" was successful and seems to be the right direction as it is related to battery settings.

Step 2: Analyzing the "Successive results" for each UI option, it's clear that none of the clickable items (id=3, id=4, id=5, id=6) directly lead to a page or section that mentions detailed battery usage by apps. However, the hint suggests that scrolling may reveal more information and the "possible paths to UI target" indicates that the "Battery Manager" and other elements related to battery information are relevant but do not directly lead to the detailed battery usage.

Step 3: Considering the task is to check the Battery Usage page and the hint provided, it is likely that the user needs to scroll to find the detailed battery usage information. The previous incorrect scroll action might have been due to a technical issue or an incorrect scroll gesture. Given that the "Battery Manager" was clicked successfully before and the hint suggests scrolling, it is reasonable to try scrolling again.

Step 4: Based on the above reasoning, the following scores are assigned:

- The "More options" (id=1) element is not directly related to checking detailed battery usage, so it gets a lower score.
- Scrolling (id=2) is the most likely next action to reveal more information about battery usage, as per the hint and previous unsuccessful attempt, so it gets the highest score.
- The clickable elements (id=3, id=4, id=5, id=6) are related to battery settings but do not directly lead to the Battery Usage page, so they receive a mid-range score, with a slightly higher score for the "Battery Manager" (id=5) as it was previously clicked successfully.

The scores are as follows:

{
    "id_1": 2.00,
    "id_2": 9.00,
    "id_3": 4.00,
    "id_4": 4.00,
    "id_5": 6.00,
    "id_6": 4.00
