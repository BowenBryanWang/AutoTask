system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," the user has navigated through "Apps & notifications" and accessed the "Advanced" settings. There is no indication of a wrong step that caused a navigate back, but the user has not yet found the setting to disable installing unknown apps from all sources.

Step 2: On the "Current UI screen," the user is presented with a list of options related to apps and notifications, such as "Recently opened apps," "Conversations," "Notifications," "Screen time," "Default apps," and "Permission manager." None of these options directly relate to disabling the installation of unknown apps. The presence of a scrollable element (<scroll id=1>) indicates there might be more options not currently visible on the screen.

Step 3: The task at hand is to disable installing unknown apps from all sources. This setting is usually found in a security or privacy-related section rather than the apps or notifications settings. Given the hint provided by the other model and the absence of a directly relevant option on the current screen, the user should scroll to explore additional settings that might include the desired security options.

Step 4: Assigning scores based on relevance to the task:
- The clickable elements id_2 to id_9 are not directly related to the task of disabling installation from unknown sources. These elements are related to app information, notifications, screen time, and permissions, but not specifically to the installation settings.
- The <scroll id=1> element is the most relevant since it allows the user to explore more options that might contain the setting to disable installing unknown apps.

Based on the above analysis, here are the scores:

{
    "id_1": 9.50, 
    "id_2": 1.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00, 
    "id_8": 1.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00
