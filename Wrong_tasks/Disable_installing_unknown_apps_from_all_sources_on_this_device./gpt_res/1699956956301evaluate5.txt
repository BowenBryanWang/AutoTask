system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Based on the provided information, the task at hand is to check the battery life and usage on the phone. The user has previously clicked on several elements related to battery settings and scrolled through a list, but those actions did not yield the desired result. The last recorded action was clicking on 'More options' which could potentially open up additional settings or details related to battery usage.

The "History operation sequence" indicates that the previous attempts to find the battery life and usage were unsuccessful. The user has tried interacting with different elements, including 'Battery' and 'Battery Manager', and also tried to scroll forward multiple times without success.

In the "Current UI screen", there is a clickable element with the title 'Battery usage'. According to the "Hint" provided by another model, this element is directly related to the user's task and should be interacted with to fulfill the task of checking the battery life and usage on the phone. The "possible paths to UI target" also suggest that the 'Battery usage' element is the correct path to follow.

Given this information, the next logical step is to click on the 'Battery usage' element to possibly access the detailed battery life and usage information.

Step 1: Review the "History operation sequence" and identify any incorrect steps. The previous attempts to access battery information were not successful.

Step 2: Evaluate the "Successive Results" and "possible paths to UI target". The 'Battery usage' element is suggested as the next step and is directly related to the task.

Step 3: Decide the next operation, which is to click on the 'Battery usage' element.

Here's the confidence rating for the UI element on the current page:

{
    "id_1": 10.00
}

This score reflects that the 'Battery usage' element is the most relevant and likely to be the correct choice for the next operation in order to complete the user's task.
