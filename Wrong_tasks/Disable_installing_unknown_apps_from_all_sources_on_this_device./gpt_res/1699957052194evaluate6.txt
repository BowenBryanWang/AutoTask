system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence," I see that the user has attempted to find information about battery life and usage by clicking on various options, including 'Battery', 'Battery Manager', and 'Battery usage', and has also scrolled through the RecyclerView multiple times. The last operation was a click on 'Battery usage', which resulted in navigating back due to an error.

Step 2: Looking at the "Successive results" for each UI option, none of the options directly mention anything about detailed battery life and usage except for the hint provided that suggests the user should continue scrolling the RecyclerView (id=2).

Step 3: The task is to check the battery life and usage. Since the user has already tried clicking on different elements without success, and given the hint that suggests the user should scroll, the most likely next step is to continue scrolling the RecyclerView to find the relevant information about battery life and usage.

Based on this analysis, the scores for the UI elements on the current screen would be:

- "id=1": This is the 'More options' button, which the user has already interacted with without success. It's unlikely to lead to battery usage details directly. Score: 2.00
- "id=2": This is the RecyclerView, which is scrollable and according to the hint, should be interacted with to find more information. Score: 9.00
- "id=3" to "id=6": These elements have been interacted with before or don't directly relate to detailed battery usage. Score: 2.00
- "id=7": This is a switch for showing battery percentage in the status bar, which does not provide detailed battery usage information. Score: 2.00

Step 4: Synthesizing the above output to output a JSON object with scores:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, "id_2": 9.00, "id_3": 2.00, "id_4": 2.00, "id_5": 2.00, "id_6": 2.00, "id_7": 2.00
}
