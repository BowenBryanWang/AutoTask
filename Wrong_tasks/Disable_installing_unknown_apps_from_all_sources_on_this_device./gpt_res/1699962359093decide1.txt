system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

NOTE in this History Pages and Action Dict format:
1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

===response===
Step 1: The history of actions shows that the user has navigated from the main settings page to the battery settings page by clicking on the 'Battery' option, which correctly contributes to the task of viewing battery usage details. The last action, which is clicking on the 'Battery' option, is appropriate as it leads the user to a page where they can potentially find detailed information about battery usage.

Step 2: The latest UI page presents several elements related to battery information, such as battery percentage, battery saver, battery manager, and screen usage since the last full charge. These elements are relevant to the user's task of viewing battery usage details. Specifically, the "Battery usage data is approximate and can change based on usage" implies that there are details available regarding battery usage. However, to fully complete the task, the user would need to view more specific details about which apps or services are using the battery, which is not currently visible on the screen.

Step 3: The presence of a scrollable element (RecyclerView) suggests that there may be more information available off-screen. The user can scroll to explore additional elements that might contain the detailed battery usage by apps and services, which is necessary to fulfill the task.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above thoughts, the conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

```json
{
    "next ui element": "<scroll id=2 class=androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView>",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The current UI shows relevant battery information, and the scrollable element suggests that more detailed battery usage information may be available off-screen, which is necessary to complete the user's task. The user should scroll to view these details."
}
```
