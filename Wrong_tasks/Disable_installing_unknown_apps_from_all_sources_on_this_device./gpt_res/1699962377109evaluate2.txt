system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: The user has already clicked on the "Battery" option, which has led them to the current screen displaying battery information. There is no indication of a wrong step that caused a navigate back.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows various battery-related information, but does not directly show "Battery Usage details." The hint from another model suggests that the user should scroll to view more details, which aligns with the task at hand.

Step 3: To view "Battery Usage details," the user likely needs to access more information that is not immediately visible on the current screen. The scrollable RecyclerView indicated by `<scroll id=2>` suggests that there may be additional information available off-screen. Since none of the clickable items on the current screen directly mention "Battery Usage details," the best course of action is to scroll to reveal more options or detailed information.

Step 4: Synthesizing the information above, the scroll action is the most relevant to the task. Here are the scores for the UI elements based on their relevance to the task of viewing battery usage details:

- "More options" (id_1) might provide access to additional settings or information, but it's not directly related to viewing battery usage details. It could be a secondary path if scrolling does not reveal the needed information. 
- The scrollable RecyclerView (id_2) is the most likely candidate to reveal the battery usage details as per the hint and the task requirement.
- The clickable items (id_3, id_4, id_5, id_6) are less likely to directly lead to the battery usage details; they seem to provide toggles or summaries of the current battery settings and status.

The scores reflecting the above reasoning would be:

```json
{
    "id_1": 4.50,
    "id_2": 9.75,
    "id_3": 2.00,
    "id_4": 2.00,
    "id_5": 2.00,
    "id_6": 2.00,
    "id_7": 1.00
}
```

The highest score is given to `<scroll id=2>` as it is the most likely element to lead to the battery usage details upon interaction.
