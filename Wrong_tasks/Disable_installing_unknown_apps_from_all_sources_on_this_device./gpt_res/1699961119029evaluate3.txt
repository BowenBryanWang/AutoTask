system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the history of operations, it seems that the user has attempted to access the "Battery Manager" multiple times, but each attempt has resulted in an error and subsequent navigation back. The user has also scrolled forward on the RecyclerView without any successful outcome.

Step 2: Analyzing the successive results of each UI option:
- id=2: Scrolling might reveal more options, but given the history, it is unclear if this will lead to the Battery Usage page.
- id=3: This button relates to app running status and does not seem to lead to the Battery Usage page.
- id=4: Battery Saver is not directly related to checking the Battery Usage page.
- id=5: Clicking on the Battery Manager previously resulted in errors, but the hint suggests that further exploration on this page is required, and it could lead to the Battery Usage page.
- id=6: Battery percentage does not lead to the Battery Usage page.

Given the hint that the Battery Manager might be the correct path and considering the task of checking the Battery Usage page, it seems reasonable to attempt to interact with the Battery Manager again. There might have been an error in previous attempts that could be resolved now.

Step 3: Deciding on the next action:
- id=2 (scroll): Scrolling might reveal more options, but it has been attempted multiple times without success. I will give it a lower score but still higher than unrelated elements: 3.00.
- id=3 (Apps are running normally button): This is not related to the Battery Usage page: 1.00.
- id=4 (Battery Saver): This is not related to the Battery Usage page: 1.00.
- id=5 (Battery Manager): Despite previous errors, the hint suggests that this element is relevant. It is the most likely candidate for the next operation: 9.00.
- id=6 (Battery percentage): This is not related to the Battery Usage page: 1.00.

Step 4: Synthesizing the output:
{
    "id_2": 3.00, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 9.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00
