system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: The history of operations indicates that there was an attempt to scroll forward on the RecyclerView, but the action did not respond and was considered incorrect. This suggests that scrolling may not have been the right action to take at that moment or the scroll action did not result in reaching the desired information.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows several elements related to battery information, such as "Battery Saver", "Battery Manager", "Battery percentage", and details about the last full charge and screen usage since the last full charge. The <scroll id=2> element is also present, indicating that there may be more information available off-screen.

The successive results indicate what is currently visible on the screen after interacting with <scroll id=2>. It lists out various battery-related information, but none of the listed items specifically mention detailed battery usage, which is what the user is looking for.

The hint from another model suggests continuing to interact with the <scroll id=2> element as it might contain more detailed battery usage information.

The possible paths to the UI target provided do not offer any additional actionable items beyond what is already visible on the screen, suggesting that the detailed battery usage information might be further down the scrollable list.

Step 3: Based on the history, the hint, and the possible paths to the UI target, it seems reasonable to continue exploring the scrollable RecyclerView to find more detailed battery usage information. Since the previous scroll action was deemed incorrect, it's possible that the user did not scroll far enough or in the correct manner to find the needed information.

Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores. Given that the hint and the possible paths suggest that scrolling might reveal the required information, and the previous action was incorrect possibly due to execution rather than intent, the <scroll id=2> element should be rated highly.

{
    "id_1": 1.00, 
    "id_2": 9.50, 
    "id_3": 1.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00
}

The <scroll id=2> element receives a high score because it is the most likely candidate to contain the information we are looking for based on the hint and the structure of the UI. All other elements receive a low score because they do not directly relate to the task of checking detailed battery usage.
