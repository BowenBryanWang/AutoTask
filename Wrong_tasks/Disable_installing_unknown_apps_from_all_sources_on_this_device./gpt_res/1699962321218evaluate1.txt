system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: The history operation sequence is empty, indicating that this is the first step in the task of viewing the battery usage details of the phone. There are no wrong steps to consider since no actions have been taken yet.

Step 2: The current UI screen is a scrollable view with various settings options. Each option is represented by a div element with a title and a summary. The task is to view battery usage details, so the relevant UI element should be related to the battery settings.

Step 3: To complete the task, we should look for the UI element that directly relates to the battery settings. In the given UI elements, div with id_5 has the title "Battery" and the summary indicates the current battery level ("100%"). This is the most relevant element to the task at hand, as it directly pertains to the battery settings where one would typically find battery usage details.

The other elements (id_2 to id_4 and id_6 to id_9) pertain to different settings such as "Network & internet," "Connected devices," "Apps & notifications," "Display," "Sound," "Storage," and "Privacy," none of which are directly related to the task of viewing battery usage details.

Step 4: Based on the relevance to the task, I will assign the following scores:

- id_5 (Battery) is the most relevant and thus receives the highest score.
- id_2 to id_4 and id_6 to id_9 are not directly related to the task and receive lower scores.
- Since there might be more options related to the task that are not currently visible, the <scroll> element (id_1) should also receive a score, though it should be lower than id_5 since we already have a clear candidate for the next action.

{
    "id_1": 2.00, "id_2": 1.00, "id_3": 1.00, "id_4": 1.00, "id_5": 10.00, "id_6": 1.00, "id_7": 1.00, "id_8": 1.00, "id_9": 1.00
