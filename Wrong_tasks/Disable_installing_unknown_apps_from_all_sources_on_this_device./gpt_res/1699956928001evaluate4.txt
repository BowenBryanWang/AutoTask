system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Review the history of operations.
- The user has attempted to check the battery life and usage by clicking on various options related to the battery but has not found the desired information.
- The user has also scrolled forward multiple times without success.
- The last recorded operation was a scroll, which did not yield the desired result and was marked as an incorrect action.

Step 2: Analyze the current UI and successive results.
- The current UI screen shows various battery-related options, including "Battery Saver," "Battery Manager," and "Battery percentage."
- The successive results for each clickable ID show similar information, with no additional details on battery life and usage.
- The hint suggests that scrolling through the RecyclerView might reveal more pertinent information.

Step 3: Decide the next step.
- Given the hint and the fact that the previous scrolls did not provide the desired information, it is likely that the user needs to continue scrolling to find the specific details about battery life and usage.
- The possible paths to the UI target show a clickable option for "Battery Manager," but the history of operations indicates that clicking on this has not been successful in the past.
- Therefore, the most likely action to take next is to continue scrolling through the RecyclerView to uncover more information.

Step 4: Assign scores to UI elements.
- The scroll action on the RecyclerView (id=2) is the most likely candidate for the next operation, as it aligns with the hint and the need to find more detailed information about the battery life and usage.
- The clickable elements such as "Battery Saver" (id=4), "Battery Manager" (id=5), and "Battery percentage" (id=6) have already been explored and did not lead to the desired information, so they receive lower scores.
- The "More options" (id=1) could potentially lead to more settings or information, but there is no clear indication that this will provide the desired battery usage details, so it receives a medium score.
