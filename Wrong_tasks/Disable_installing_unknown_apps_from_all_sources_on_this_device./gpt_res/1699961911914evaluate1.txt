system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: There is no history of operations, so we are starting fresh on this task. There are no previous wrong steps to consider.

Step 2: On the current UI screen, we have several clickable elements that represent different settings of the phone. Since the task is to check the Battery Usage details, we need to find the UI element that most likely leads to the battery settings.

- <div id=2> with "Network & internet" is not relevant to the battery usage details.
- <div id=3> with "Connected devices" is also not relevant to the battery usage details.
- <div id=4> with "Apps & notifications" could be slightly relevant since apps can affect battery usage, but it's not directly related to checking the battery usage details.
- <div id=5> with "Battery" is highly relevant because it directly mentions the battery and is likely the entry point to battery usage details.
- <div id=6> with "Display" could indirectly affect battery usage, but it's not where you would find battery usage details.
- <div id=7> with "Sound" is not relevant to battery usage details.
- <div id=8> with "Storage" is not relevant to battery usage details.
- <div id=9> with "Privacy" is not relevant to battery usage details.

Step 3: Given the task to check the Battery Usage details, the next step should be to click on the element that leads to the battery settings.

Step 4: Synthesizing the above information, here is the JSON object with the scores for each UI element:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, // <scroll> is less relevant since we see the target "Battery" on screen.
    "id_2": 1.00, // "Network & internet" is not related to battery details.
    "id_3": 1.00, // "Connected devices" is not related to battery details.
    "id_4": 3.00, // "Apps & notifications" has minor relevance due to app battery usage.
    "id_5": 10.00, // "Battery" is the most likely candidate to lead to battery usage details.
    "id_6": 1.00, // "Display" is not directly related to battery usage details.
    "id_7": 1.00, // "Sound" is not related to battery usage details.
    "id_8": 1.00, // "Storage" is not related to battery usage details.
    "id_9": 1.00  // "Privacy" is not related to battery usage details.
