system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the history operation sequence, it seems the user has been navigating through the "Apps & notifications" settings and has attempted to find the correct setting by clicking on specific apps and scrolling through the list. However, there have been a couple of errors, leading to navigate back actions.

Step 2: The task is to disable installing unknown apps from all sources. The current UI screen is showing a list of apps, but none of these apps are directly relevant to the task at hand. The "Search" option could potentially be used to find the relevant setting, as could the "More options" which might lead to a menu with additional actions. Scrolling could reveal more apps or settings that are not currently visible on the screen.

Step 3: Given the task, the most likely paths to find the setting to disable installing unknown apps would be through the "Search" function, the "More options" menu, or by continuing to scroll through the settings. Since none of the individual apps listed are directly relevant to the task, they should receive a lower score.

Step 4: Synthesizing the output, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:

- "Search" (id_1) could be used to directly search for the setting, so it should receive a high score.
- "More options" (id_2) might contain a relevant setting or shortcut to the security settings, so it should also receive a high score.
- Scrolling (id_3) is necessary if the first two options do not yield results, and since we need to explore more options, it should receive a moderate score.
- The individual apps (id_4 to id_12) are not directly related to the task and should receive the lowest scores.

Here are the ratings:

{
    "id_1": 8.50, 
    "id_2": 8.50, 
    "id_3": 6.00, 
    "id_4": 1.00, 
    "id_5": 1.00, 
    "id_6": 1.00, 
    "id_7": 1.00, 
    "id_8": 1.00, 
    "id_9": 1.00, 
    "id_10": 1.00, 
    "id_11": 1.00, 
    "id_12": 1.00
}

The "Search" and "More options" are equally likely candidates to lead to the desired setting, hence the same score for both. Scrolling is less likely but still a necessary action if the other two do not yield the desired result. The individual apps are not relevant to the task at hand.
