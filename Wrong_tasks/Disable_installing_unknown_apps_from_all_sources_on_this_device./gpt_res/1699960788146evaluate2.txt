system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: The history of operations indicates that the user has already clicked on the "Battery" section and attempted to scroll forward on a RecyclerView, but the action did not yield a response, which is marked as an error. This suggests that either the scroll action was not registered properly, or there was no additional content to display at that time.

Step 2: The successive results provided for "id=2" show a list of elements related to battery information. The presence of a RecyclerView indicates that there may be additional information off-screen that could be relevant to the task of checking the Battery Usage page.

Step 3: Based on the hint provided by another model, the recommended next element to interact with is the scrollable RecyclerView ("id=2"). This aligns with the need to explore further since the RecyclerView may contain more information related to the battery usage that is not currently visible on the screen.

Step 4: Given the task of checking the Battery Usage page and the information provided, the scrollable RecyclerView ("id=2") should be the next element to interact with, as it is likely to contain more detailed battery usage information that is pertinent to the task. Other clickable elements on the page are related to battery settings and status but do not directly pertain to the detailed battery usage statistics that the user is tasked with checking. Therefore, the rating for the RecyclerView should be the highest.

The JSON object with the scores is as follows:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, // "More options" is less relevant to the task of checking battery usage details.
    "id_2": 9.50, // Scrollable RecyclerView is highly relevant as it may contain more information related to the task.
    "id_3": 3.00, // The button with "Apps are running normally" is less relevant to the specific task of checking battery usage.
    "id_4": 3.00, // "Battery Saver" settings are less relevant to checking detailed battery usage.
    "id_5": 6.50, // "Battery Manager" might be relevant, but it's not clear if it leads to detailed usage stats.
    "id_6": 3.00, // "Battery percentage" settings are less relevant to checking detailed battery usage.
    "id_7": 1.00  // The switch for showing battery percentage is not relevant to the task of checking battery usage details.
