system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

([] means it's empty in the latest page and cannot go on)


===response===
Step 1:
The user's task is to check the battery usage details of their phone. The history of actions shows that the user has navigated to the battery settings by clicking on the "Battery" option from the main settings menu. This action is on the correct track for fulfilling the user's task, as battery usage details are typically found within the battery settings section of a phone's settings menu.

Step 2:
The latest UI page presents several elements related to battery information, including "Battery Saver," "Battery Manager," "Battery percentage," "Last full charge," and "Screen usage since full charge." These elements provide a general overview of the battery's current state and recent usage statistics. However, the user's task is to check detailed battery usage, which often includes seeing a breakdown of which apps or services are consuming battery power. There is a "<scroll>" element present, indicating that there may be more information available below the current view. This suggests that the user can continue to explore this page to potentially find more detailed battery usage data.

Step 3:
The presence of the "<scroll>" element in the androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView indicates that there is additional content that can be viewed by scrolling. This content may include the detailed battery usage by individual apps or system services, which is necessary to fulfill the user's task. Therefore, it is worth exploring the elements that become visible after scrolling.

Step 4:
Synthesizing the above thoughts, the conclusion on the STATUS is as follows:

```json
{
    "next ui element": "<scroll>",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The current UI page contains a scrollable area that may reveal further details about battery usage, which is necessary to complete the user's task of checking battery usage details."
}
```
