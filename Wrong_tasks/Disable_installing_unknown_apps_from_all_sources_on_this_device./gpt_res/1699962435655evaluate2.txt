system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: The history shows that the user has clicked on the battery option and attempted to scroll forward but there was no response, indicating that the scroll operation was incorrect.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows several elements that could be related to viewing battery usage details:
- "More options" could provide additional settings or information but it's not specific to battery usage details.
- The scrollable RecyclerView likely contains more items related to battery usage.
- The button with "Apps are running normally" and "Phone has typical background battery usage" does not seem to provide detailed battery usage.
- The clickable divs for "Battery Saver", "Battery Manager", and "Battery percentage" provide settings or statuses but not detailed usage information.
- The paragraphs for "Last full charge" and "Screen usage since full charge" provide some information but not detailed usage.
- The hint suggests that scrolling the RecyclerView could lead to more detailed information.

Step 3: Based on the hint and the fact that the RecyclerView is scrollable and contains several items related to battery information, it's likely that scrolling will reveal more details about the battery usage. The "Battery Manager" and "Battery Saver" options seem to offer configuration settings rather than usage details, and the "Battery percentage" switch toggles the display of the percentage in the status bar.

Given that the user wants to view battery usage details and the previous scroll operation was incorrect, we should reconsider the scroll option as the UI might not have responded due to a technical glitch or user error.

Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores:

- "More options" (id=1) is not likely to lead directly to battery usage details, but it could be a secondary path if the scroll does not work: 4.00
- Scrolling (id=2) is suggested by the hint and is a common way to reveal more information in a RecyclerView, and given that the previous scroll operation was incorrect, it should be tried again: 9.50
- The button related to apps running normally (id=3) does not seem to lead to detailed battery usage: 2.00
- The clickable divs for "Battery Saver" (id=4), "Battery Manager" (id=5), and "Battery percentage" (id=6) are more about settings than detailed usage: 3.00, 3.00, 3.00 respectively.
- The switch for showing battery percentage (id=7) is also a setting and not related to detailed usage: 2.00

The JSON object with scores is:

{
    "id_1": 4.00, "id_2": 9.50, "id_3": 2.00, "id_4": 3.00, "id_5": 3.00, "id_6": 3.00, "id_7": 2.00
