system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

===response===
Step 1: Reviewing the "History operation sequence", the user clicked on the "Battery" option and scrolled forward but received no response, indicating a wrong operation. Then the user clicked on "Battery Manager", which seems to be a correct step, as the user did not navigate back.

Step 2: Analyzing the "Successive results" of each UI option, all options lead to a similar list of battery-related information. It is important to note that the user is tasked with checking the battery life and usage.

Step 3: Deciding the next step, we have to consider the hint provided by another model, which suggests continuing with the scroll element to reveal more information. Since the user's task is to check the battery life and usage, and the scrollable list contains battery-related information, it's likely that the necessary details to complete the task are within this scrollable area.

Step 4: Synthesizing the output, the <scroll id=2> element is the most relevant as it contains all the battery-related information and there is a suggestion that there might be more information available upon scrolling. The other clickable elements seem to lead to settings or toggles for battery features, which are less relevant to just checking the battery life and usage.

Given this analysis, the scores for the UI elements are as follows:

- "id_1" represents the "More options" button, which is not directly related to checking battery life and usage, so it gets a lower score.
- "id_2" is the scrollable RecyclerView, which is likely to contain the battery life and usage information the user is looking for. It gets the highest score.
- "id_3" to "id_6" represent various battery settings, which are less relevant to the task at hand since they are more about configuration rather than checking the current battery status.
- "id_7" is a switch for showing battery percentage in the status bar, which is not directly related to checking detailed battery life and usage.

Here are the scores:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 10.00, 
    "id_3": 3.00, 
    "id_4": 3.00, 
    "id_5": 3.00, 
    "id_6": 3.00, 
    "id_7": 2.00
}
