system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

Step 1: The user's task is to check the battery life and usage on the phone. The history of operations shows multiple attempts to scroll and click on items that did not yield the desired information, specifically clicking on "Battery" and "Battery Manager" did not provide the necessary details.

Step 2: The successive results indicate that clicking on various items such as "Apps are running normally", "Battery Saver", "Battery Manager", "Battery percentage", and the switch associated with the battery percentage does not lead to battery life and usage details. Scrolling the RecyclerView might reveal more information.

Step 3: Considering the user's task, the hint provided, and the possible paths to the UI target, the best course of action is to continue scrolling the RecyclerView to find more detailed information on battery life and usage. The hint suggests that the last action was relevant, and more information is likely available by scrolling.

Step 4: Given the above reasoning, the scrollable RecyclerView (id_2) is the most relevant element to interact with next. Other clickable elements have been tried before and did not provide the required information, so they will be rated lower.

Here is the confidence rating for the UI elements:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, 
    "id_2": 9.50, 
    "id_3": 3.00, 
    "id_4": 3.00, 
    "id_5": 3.00, 
    "id_6": 3.00, 
    "id_7": 3.00
}

The scrollable RecyclerView (id_2) has the highest score because it is most likely to contain the information the user is looking for. The other elements have lower scores because they have been tried previously or are less likely to provide the specific battery life and usage details required.
