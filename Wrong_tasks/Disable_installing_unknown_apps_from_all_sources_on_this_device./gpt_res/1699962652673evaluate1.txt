system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.


user:
{
    "Task": "Disable the option to install apps from unknown sources on the device.",
    "History operation sequence": [],
    "Current UI screen": "<scroll id=1 class=android.widget.ScrollView >\n    <div id=2   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Network & internet </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Wi\u2011Fi, mobile, data usage, and hotspot </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=3   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Connected devices </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Bluetooth, Android Auto </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=4   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Apps & notifications </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Recent apps, default apps </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=5   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Battery </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > 100% </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=6   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Display </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Wallpaper, sleep, font size </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=7   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Sound </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Volume, vibration, Do Not Disturb </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=8   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Storage </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > 28% used - 5.77 GB free </p>\n </div>\n\n    <div id=9   clickable> \n    <p class='android:id/title'  > Privacy </p>\n\n    <p class='android:id/summary'  > Permissions, account activity, personal data </p>\n </div>\n </scroll>\n",
    "Successive results": {}
}

Step 1: There is no history of operations yet, so we don't have any past mistakes to consider.

Step 2: To disable the option to install apps from unknown sources, we need to navigate to the security settings of the device. On most Android devices, this setting is located under the "Security" or "Privacy" section. Given the options on the current UI screen, the "Apps & notifications" and "Privacy" sections are the most relevant to our task. 

Step 3: The "Apps & notifications" section might contain app permissions and advanced settings, but typically the option to install apps from unknown sources is found under the security or privacy settings. Therefore, the "Privacy" section is more likely to lead us to the correct setting.

Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

- "Network & internet" (id_2) is unrelated to app installation settings.
- "Connected devices" (id_3) is unrelated to app installation settings.
- "Apps & notifications" (id_4) could potentially contain relevant settings but is not the most likely place for installation settings from unknown sources.
- "Battery" (id_5) is unrelated to app installation settings.
- "Display" (id_6) is unrelated to app installation settings.
- "Sound" (id_7) is unrelated to app installation settings.
- "Storage" (id_8) is unrelated to app installation settings.
- "Privacy" (id_9) is the most likely section to contain the option to disable installation from unknown sources.

Given these considerations, I would rate the elements as follows:

{
    "id_1": 2.00, "id_2": 1.00, "id_3": 1.00, "id_4": 6.50, "id_5": 1.00, "id_6": 1.00, "id_7": 1.00, "id_8": 1.00, "id_9": 9.50
}

The "Privacy" section (id_9) receives the highest score as it is the most likely place to find the setting to disable installation from unknown sources. The "Apps & notifications" section (id_4) receives a moderate score because it could potentially lead to relevant settings, but it is not as likely as the "Privacy" section. The scroll element (id_1) receives a low score because while it allows us to explore more options, we already have a strong candidate on the screen. All other elements are not related to the task and receive the lowest score.
