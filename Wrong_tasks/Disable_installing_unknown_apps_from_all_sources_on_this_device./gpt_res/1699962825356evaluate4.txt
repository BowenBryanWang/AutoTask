system:
You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Judger". Your specialized role focuses on guiding the user to complete the user task on specific UI screen.
Your job is to rate the available UI elements on the current page.
Note that:
    (1) The element with the highest score will be choosen as the next element to be operated. If you have more than one top scoring option in your scoring, it's a good idea to highlight the score of one of the most likely candidates to avoid confusion.
    (2) Your score should be accurate to two decimal places.
    (3) If you think none of the elements can be the next to be operated, you can try to explore the UI to gather more information and rating the elements according to their semantic simialrities with the user task.
    (4) <scroll /> element means there is a list and you can interact with it by scrolling forward. If you want to explore more, you can also try giving <scroll/> a relatively high scorat. The score of the <scroll /> should always be higher than that of those appearantly unrelated with the task.
For each option, provide a confidence rating from 1.00-10.00, based on the relation of each option to the task, where 1.00 is the lowest tier indicating complete irrelevance and may lead to errors, 2.00-4.00 is the second tier indicating minor relevance, 4.00-6.00 is the medium tier indicating neutrality, 6.00-8.00 indicates higher relevance, possibly a candidate, and 10.00 indicates the most likely to be chosen and executed.
The structure of the output should be: {
    "id_x": <rating>, ...}, where "id_x" is the id of an operational element (you should replace "x" with an actual value and iterate over all possible values), and "<rating>" denotes its rating.
Example:
{
    "id_1": 5.53, "id_2": 9.71, "id_3": 3.20
}
Think step by step and output your reasoning process:
Step 1: think about ["History operation sequence"],what has been done,especially pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 2: think step by step on the ["Succesive Results"] of each UI options GIVEN by user, which represents the subsequent items after operating on them, and the ["possible paths to UI target"] GIVEN by user, which was suggested by expert knowledge;
Step 3: decide what should be done next. Possible operations: click, edit (text input), scroll. Pay attention to those steps which is wrong and caused navigate back if any;
Step 4: Synthesize the above output to output a JSON object with scores.

Strictly output a format like "id_1": 3.00, do not tamper with it to make it look like "scroll_1": 3.00, etc., it must start with id_.

    "Hint": "Below is a hint and suggestion from another model{\"next ui element\": \"scroll\", \"status\": \"go on\", \"reason\": \"The current UI page includes a scroll element, suggesting there may be additional settings not currently visible that could lead to the task fulfillment of disabling apps from unknown sources.\"}"
}

===response===
Step 1: The history shows that the user initially tried to access the "Privacy" settings but navigated back due to an error. They then accessed "Apps & notifications" and went into "Advanced," after which they scrolled forward in the RecyclerView.

Step 2: The current UI screen shows various elements related to apps and notifications settings. There is a scrollable list which includes options such as "See all 24 apps," "Conversations," "Notifications," "Screen time," "Default apps," "Permission manager," "Wireless emergency alerts," and "Special app access." The task is to disable the option to install apps from unknown sources, which is likely to be found under a security or advanced settings menu rather than within the apps & notifications settings themselves. However, since the user has been navigating within this menu, it's possible the correct setting might be further down the list.

Step 3: Following the hint provided, which suggests continuing to scroll to reveal more options, it is reasonable to give the scroll action a higher score. None of the other options on the current screen directly indicate a setting related to installing apps from unknown sources, so they will receive lower scores.

Step 4: Synthesize the scores based on the relevance to the task:
- The "See all 24 apps" button might lead to a list of all apps but is unlikely to contain the setting for installing from unknown sources.
- The "Conversations," "Notifications," "Screen time," "Default apps," "Permission manager," "Wireless emergency alerts," and "Special app access" are all somewhat related to app settings but do not specifically indicate they would contain the option to disable installation from unknown sources.
- The <scroll /> element is the most likely candidate to reveal additional settings that could contain the desired option.

Based on this reasoning, the JSON object with scores would be:

{
    "id_1": 8.00, 
    "id_2": 2.00, 
    "id_3": 2.00, 
    "id_4": 2.00, 
    "id_5": 2.00, 
    "id_6": 2.00, 
    "id_7": 2.00, 
    "id_8": 2.00, 
    "id_9": 2.00, 
    "id_10": 2.00, 
    "id_11": 2.00
