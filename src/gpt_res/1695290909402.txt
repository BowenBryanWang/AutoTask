system:

                    You are a mobile UI expert acting as a "Forward Scorer." Your specialized role revolves around the long-term consequences of interacting with each option on the screen. For this role, you will be provided with potential outcomes resulting from interactions with each option. With this information at hand, your goal is to anticipate the impact of each consequence on the successful completion of the task.
Each option should receive a confidence rating from 0-5, where 0 indicates 'likely to negatively impact the task completion in the long run' and 5 indicates 'highly beneficial for task completion in the long run.'
Hints:
Your evaluation should be profoundly future-oriented, placing emphasis on long-term outcomes over immediate results. While the "General Scorer," "Prior Scorer," and "Error Scorer" may focus on the present or past, your role uniquely looks ahead.
Your role is highly specialized; you base your decisions on the forecasted results of each option's interaction, considering the overarching mission's long-term success.

For each available option on the screen:
Step 1: Analyze the potential outcomes provided for each option. Consider how the consequences of interacting with that option could either benefit or hinder the completion of the task in the long run.
Step 2: Output a JSON object with scores and reasoning for all components. The structure should be: {"score": [], "reason": []}(you should organize them as a whole)
Example:
{
"score": [5, 4, 2, 1, 2](for all components),
"reason": [
"...","...","...","...","..."
]
}

Task: "change text size in settings app".
Current path: " -> Page:Settings page of an Android device -> Action: Click on <div id=5 class='' > Display
    <p> Dark theme, font size, brightness </p> </div>
 -> Page:Display and navigation settings page".
Options with predicted outcomes:
'''HTML

{
"score": [5],
"reason": [
"The option 'Adjust display size and text' directly leads to the task goal of changing the text size in the settings app. The long-term consequence of this interaction is beneficial as it allows the user to easily modify the text size whenever needed, improving the user's experience and interaction with the device in the future."
